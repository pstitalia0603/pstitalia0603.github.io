		"content": "30 Useful Concepts (Spring 2024)\nhttps://www.substack.com/@gurwinder\nIt’s that time again; a summary of interesting and useful concepts to spur your curiosity. Click the titles for more information.\n1. Dopamine Culture\n\n“Every kind of organized distraction tends to become progressively more and more imbecile.” — Aldous Huxley\n\nThe delay between desire &amp; gratification is shrinking. Pleasure is increasingly more instant &amp; effortless. Everything is becoming a drug. What will it do to us?\n\n](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fa6f337-7d2c-4a37-97e9-38f29f12b017_1490x860.jpeg)\n2. False Consensus Effect\n\n“Everyone driving slower than you is an idiot and everyone driving faster than you is a maniac.” — George Carlin\n\nOur model of the world assumes people are like us. We don’t just do whatever we consider normal, we also consider normal whatever we do.\n3. Fredkin's Paradox\nThe more similar two choices seem, the less the decision should matter, yet the harder it is to choose between them. As a result, we often spend the most time on the decisions that matter least.\nTo avoid being paralyzed by meaningless choices, use decision-making heuristics.\n4. Package-Deal Ethics\n\n“If I can predict all of your beliefs from one of your beliefs, you’re not a serious thinker.” — Chris Williamson\n\nBeing pro-choice and pro-gun-control don't logically follow from each other, yet those who believe one usually also believe the other. This is because most people don’t choose beliefs individually but subscribe to “packages” of beliefs offered by a tribe.\n5. Ovsiankina Effect (aka Hemingway Effect)\nWe have an intrinsic need to finish what we’ve started. Exploit this by taking your breaks mid-task; the incompleteness will gnaw at you, increasing your motivation to return to work. (When writing, I end each day mid-sentence because it\n6. Naxalt Fallacy\nSmart people tend to use qualifiers like “generally” and “most”, and dumb people tend to ignore them.\n\n“Most people who are pro-choice are also pro-gun-control.”\n“Wrong! I’m not!”\n\n“Men are generally taller than women.”\n“False! My wife is 7 feet tall!”\n\n[\n\n](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faffa74fa-56ff-4924-a3ff-1da3fba22f6d_500x441.jpeg)\n7. Fiction Lag (aka Experience-Taking)\nWhen people are captivated by a work of fiction, they unconsciously adopt the traits of their favorite characters. We develop our identities by copying others, and perhaps one reason we enjoy fiction is that it gives us ideas on who to be.\n8. Premortem\n&quot;Hindsight is 20/20.&quot;\nInstead of waiting for something to go wrong and then conducting a post-mortem, conduct a “pre-mortem” by imagining it went wrong then using the power of hindsight to deduce the likeliest reason it went wrong.\n\nImagine you wake up in a hospital. What could have been the most likely reason? Is there anything you can do today to prevent that?\nImagine your partner breaks up with you. What could have been the most likely reason? Is there anything you can do today to prevent that?\nImagine you lose your job. What could have been the most likely reason? Is there anything you can do today to prevent that?\n—Luca Dellanna\n\n9. Gambler’s Conceit\nPeople hooked on a risky behavior (e.g. gambling, smoking) reassure themselves they’ll be able to quit while ahead (before bankruptcy, lung cancer). However, their future-self tends to act a lot like them, so if they can't quit now, they likely won't quit later when they’re even deeper in.\n10. Youngest-Kid-in-Class Syndrome\nA study of 300,000 children found that the youngest kids in class were more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD. This suggests that immaturity is sometimes being mistaken for disorders.\n[\n\n](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F707a63a5-7c47-4101-9621-9a930427a278_1152x886.png)\ndiscusses this further in his incisive piece (paywalled)\n11. Noble Cause Corruption\nThe greatest evils come not from people seeking to do evil, but people seeking to do good and believing the ends justify the means. Everyone who was on the wrong side of history believed they were on the right side.\n\nGrey Rock Method\n\nReacting emotionally to narcissists and other toxic people only gives them what they want — your time &amp; energy — which encourages further abuse. If you want to stop receiving provocations, stop being provoked. When the narcissist realizes they can’t manipulate your emotions, they’ll stop trying.\n13. Woozle Effect\nWhen a source makes an unproven claim, is then cited as proof by another, which is cited by another, and so on, until the chain of citations looks like evidence. Common because, while many writers check their sources, few check their sources’ sources.\nA recent example: evidence that puberty blockers are safe and effective was overestimated because institutions were circularly citing each other:\n[\n\n](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcac7662b-5487-4176-ae6a-2d1fd7182c18_1280x928.jpeg)\n14. Postjournalism\nThe press lost its monopoly on news when the internet democratized info. To save its business model, it pivoted from journalism into tribalism. The new role of the press is not to inform its readers but to confirm what they already believe.\n15. Adams’ 25% rule (aka Skill-Stacking)\nInstead of trying to be the best at one thing, try to be &quot;merely&quot; great at two things and then learn to combine them. Not only is this easier, but it will make your skillset more unique, cutting out the competition.\n16. Backwards Law\nThe more you pursue happiness, the less likely you are to obtain it, because the focus on acquiring it only reinforces the fact that you don’t have it. Ironically, happiness comes easiest to those who don’t worry about it.\n\n“Happiness is like a butterfly, the more you chase it, the more it will evade you, but if you notice the other things around you, it will gently come and sit on your shoulder.”\n― Henry David Thoreau\n\n17. Balaji's Transformer\nHave a written idea? Draw it. Have a visual idea? Write it. Reformatting an idea lets you see it from a new perspective. Walt Disney turned a dull business plan into a diagram, revealing new connections and opening new pathways of thought.\n[\n\n](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52c85a01-11ad-4e14-89fb-248e40b248c0_1480x1295.jpeg)\n18. Longevity Escape Velocity\nTechnology is gradually improving our lifespans, so if you try to live as long as possible, you may live to see technology that'll allow you to live even longer. Time is the most valuable currency of all, and longevity yields compound interest.\n19. Roseto Effect\nMany long-term studies, including the 50 year Roseto study and the 85 year Harvard Study of Adult Development, found that having close-knit relationships is as important for longevity as diet, sleep, and exercise, yet it’s often neglected by fitness gurus. If you want to live, love.\n\nHitchens' Razor\n\n“What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.”\n― Christopher Hitchens\n\nIf you make a claim, it's up to you to prove it, not to me to disprove it.\n\nThe Liking Gap\n\nMultiple studies have found that people consistently underestimate how much a conversation partner likes them and enjoys their company. So don't be shy, you're probably cooler than you think.\n\nBoomerang Effect\n\nDeny someone something, and they'll want it even more, out of defiance. If you want your child to eat broccoli, tell them they’re not big enough to eat broccoli.\nHelps explain why censorship often backfires (the Streisand Effect).\n\nAnchored-to-your-own-history bias\n\n“Your personal experiences make up maybe 0.00000001% of what’s happened in the world but maybe 80% of how you think the world works.” — Morgan Housel\n\nBoomers &amp; Generation X had wildly different experiences of how the economy works, and this gave them different dispositions, worldviews, and political preferences.\n[\n\n](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6fcb6605-e762-474b-83fb-faf6caac75bb_1426x796.jpeg)\n\nMismatch Theory\n\nMoths evolved to navigate by the moon, a good strategy until the invention of electric lamps, which now lead them astray. Equally, humans evolved to be tribal, a good strategy until the digital age, where it now leads us to act like polarized goons online.\n\nCommon Knowledge Effect\n\nGroups are meant to be better decision-makers than individuals, because they combine many perspectives. But in practice, a group doesn't base its decisions on the info specific to each member, but only on the info common to them all. This casts doubt on the idea that “two heads are better than one”, and helps explain why, despite popular wisdom, diversity generally does not make teams better.\n\nChampion Bias\n\nWe assume winners have the best advice, but those who win rarely examine why they won, while those who lose often regretfully dwell on their mistakes. So you’ll often obtain the best advice on winning not from winners but from losers.\n\nGibson’s Law\n\n“For every PhD there is an equal and opposite PhD.”\nBoth sides in a court case or policy debate will have support from experts, no matter how crazy the position, because education doesn’t make someone right, it often just makes them more skilled at being wrong.\n\nProspect Theory\n\nPeople don’t weigh gains and losses evenly. We hate losing money about twice as much as we like gaining it. So, for instance, we’d need to gain $20 to assuage the pain of losing $10. This bias toward loss aversion is one of the foundations of economic behavior.\n\nCached Thoughts\n\nMost of your beliefs were formed earlier in your life, when you were naiver. You continue to believe them only because you’ve never reconsidered them. When you’re about to offer an opinion, consider when you formed it, and ask: is it really your belief, or your younger self’s?\n\nFinality Principle\n\nOne day you’ll do something for the last time and never know it. So, whether you’re watching a sunset or arguing with a friend, ask yourself: “What if this was the last time I experience this?” A sense of finality can turn even nuisances into miracles.\n\n“Death is always on the way, but the fact that you don't know when it will arrive seems to take away from the finiteness of life. It's that terrible precision that we hate so much. But because we don't know, we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well. Yet everything happens a certain number of times, and a very small number, really. How many more times will you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood, some afternoon that's so deeply a part of your being that you can't even conceive of your life without it? Perhaps four or five times more. Perhaps not even. How many more times will you watch the full moon rise? Perhaps twenty. And yet it all seems limitless.”\n― Paul Bowles, The Sheltering Sky\n\nAnd that’s 30 concepts. As usual, don’t mistake these rules of thumb for laws of nature, as that would be a fallacy called Secundum Quid.\nI’m going to start scheduling video-calls with paid subscribers again soon; will give more details in my next post. Until then, peace.",

		"content": "Honestly with Bari Weiss: Jonathan Haidt: Smartphones Rewired Childhood. Here's How to Fix It.\nEpisode webpage: https://www.bariweiss.com/\nMedia file: https://pdst.fm/e/mgln.ai/track/verifi.podscribe.com/rss/p/chrt.fm/track/384D27/pscrb.fm/rss/p/traffic.megaphone.fm/RSV3188865547.mp3?updated=1711480150\nSocial psychologist Jonathan Haidt has been explaining the human condition to us better than anyone else. He first did it with his book The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion, which explored why people were so passionately divided over politics and religion, and argued that people are fundamentally religiously inclined creatures. Then, he did it again with The Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure, which laid out why kids today—especially on college campuses—have become so intolerant of opinions that conflict with their own.\nNow, he’s done it once more with his new book, The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness. This time, Haidt explains what so many parents have been confused by for the last decade: Why are kids today more anxious than ever, more depressed than ever, more risk-averse than ever, lonelier than ever, and less social than ever?\nIt’s pretty simple, Haidt argues: We changed childhood.\nThe mass migration of childhood, Haidt says, from the real world to the virtual world has completely changed what it means to be a kid. By replacing free and independent play and quality time with friends with the isolation of screens and phones, we instigated what he calls the “Great Rewiring of Childhood.” What resulted, he argues, is a childhood that is “more sedentary, solitary, virtual, and incompatible with healthy human development.”\nToday, Haidt explains how this massive change happened, its detrimental effects on kids, and what actions we can take—both in our own lives and legislatively—in order to reverse course and free the anxious generation.\nTranscript\nSocial psychologist Jonathan Height will be remembered as one of the most important thinkers of the 21st century. And that's not because he's sending spaceships to Mars, or because he's working on fusion energy, or because he's figured out how to solve the chip problem. It's because Jonathan has been explaining our condition to ourselves better than almost anyone else out there.\nHe did it first with his book The Righteous Mind, which helped explain why people are so passionately divided over politics and religion, and which also made the argument that human\nbeings are fundamentally religiously inclined creatures.\nThen, he did it again with the coddling of the American mind, which he co-wrote with Greg Lukinov. That book laid out why kids today, especially kids on college campuses, have become so intolerant of opinions that conflict with their own, and how that intolerance has impacted the culture and the country. And now, John Height has done it once more, with his new book The Anxious Generation, How the Great Rewiring of Childhood is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness. This time, John explains what so many parents have been confounded by for the last decade. Why, despite all of our luxuries and privileges and wealth, are kids today more anxious than ever, more depressed than ever, more risk averse than ever, more lonely than ever, and less social than ever before? Well, it's pretty simple, John argues. We fundamentally changed childhood. The mass migration of childhood from the real world into the virtual one has completely transformed what it means to grow up. In replacing free play and interaction with friends and other people, and really just the world, with the isolation of screens and phones, we instigated what he calls the great rewiring of childhood. What he means by this is that childhood, as he writes, was rewired into a form that was more sedentary, solitary, virtual, and incompatible with healthy human development.\nA few weeks ago, we had a conversation on this show with Abigail Shrier about many of these topics and questions. It sparked a huge response and a lot of letters to the editor, some of which we published on the Free Press. But what we heard was loud and clear, conversations about parenting and childhood aren't just important for parents, they're important for everybody because the kids of today are becoming the people that will lead our culture and our country in the future. That future, the one all of us will live in, is inextricably linked with how we raise the next generation of adults. So today, we are absolutely thrilled to bring back Jonathan Haidt.\n00:04:07,140 --&gt; 00:04:09,460\nJohn Height, thank you so much for being here today.\nThanks for having me back.\nSo you were born 20 years before me. You were born in 1963. And if you would, just tell me a little bit about your childhood. How did you grow up?\nWell, now I recognize that I had just the quintessential post-war America childhood. I grew up in Westchester County in the suburb North of New York City. And the key thing is that it was just assumed that kids are on their own when they don't have to be somewhere. And by 2nd and 3rd grade, I was walking over to my friend's house who lived about half mile away. We would come up with games to play. Me and my best friend, Christor, or we'd meet up with a couple other kids. Or once how we had a rock fight with some kids at a nearby school, just you have adventures.\n76\n00:04:54,340 --&gt; 00:04:58,900\nBasically, I had a free range childhood, like everybody, as everybody else did back then.\n77\n00:04:58,900 --&gt; 00:05:01,260\nAnd that kind of ended in the 90s.\n78\n00:05:01,260 --&gt; 00:05:04,820\nIt's almost like you and I grew up in a different world.\n79\n00:05:04,820 --&gt; 00:05:05,820\nIt really is.\n80\n00:05:05,820 --&gt; 00:05:06,940\nPaint the picture for us.\n81\n00:05:06,940 --&gt; 00:05:10,820\nWhat does the average American childhood look like today?\n82\n00:05:10,820 --&gt; 00:05:14,140\nSo kids are locked up until they're in middle school.\n83\n00:05:14,140 --&gt; 00:05:17,980\nYou don't see eight-eight-year-olds walking around the way we did when we were kids.\n84\n00:05:17,980 --&gt; 00:05:22,820\nAnd the latest data that I've seen Gallup has a survey out from last year, if you just look at social media, just social media.\n86\n00:05:25,060 --&gt; 00:05:29,860\nAnd that includes TikTok and YouTube videos, which is the biggest time suckers those two.\n87\n00:05:29,860 --&gt; 00:05:33,300\nIt's five hours a day, seven days a week.\n88\n00:05:33,300 --&gt; 00:05:34,860\nFor girls, it's even higher.\n89\n00:05:34,860 --&gt; 00:05:37,020\nThat's just social media.\n90\n00:05:37,020 --&gt; 00:05:39,020\nNow you add in video games and all the other stuff.\n91\n00:05:39,020 --&gt; 00:05:40,420\nYou're up around nine hours a day.\n92\n00:05:40,420 --&gt; 00:05:42,020\nThat's the average.\n93\n00:05:42,020 --&gt; 00:05:44,620\nThere are many kids who are spending a lot more than that.\n94\n00:05:44,620 --&gt; 00:05:49,940\nSo I want to make the point that first, the quantity is just hard to comprehend.\n95\n00:05:49,940 --&gt; 00:05:51,660\nIt's mind-boggling.\n96\n00:05:51,660 --&gt; 00:05:58,020\nThe most stunning thing is that Gen Z, kids born after 1995, Gen Z has been giving up time with friends outside of school.\n98\n00:05:59,900 --&gt; 00:06:05,420\nYou label all of these changes as the great rewiring of childhood.\n99\n00:06:05,420 --&gt; 00:06:10,980\nBut the change didn't just happen with the advent of the iPhone or the Android or with the like button.\n101\n00:06:12,180 --&gt; 00:06:19,860\nYou trace the change to sort of the 1980s and with the transformation away from free play to a much more fear-based childhood.\n103\n00:06:24,820 --&gt; 00:06:29,500\nWhat drove the sort of shift away from letting kids like you go and play on their own and figure out how to stone each other without killing each other in the westchester?\n105\n00:06:34,940 --&gt; 00:06:38,700\nWhen did that begin to shift and why culturally?\n106\n00:06:38,700 --&gt; 00:06:39,700\nYeah.\n107\n00:06:39,700 --&gt; 00:06:42,940\nSo it's not just like, oh, the phones are hurting our kids.\n108\n00:06:42,940 --&gt; 00:06:46,460\nIt's like, here's what childhood is.\n109\n00:06:46,460 --&gt; 00:06:49,140\nBecause human childhood is this amazing evolutionary adaptation.\n110\n00:06:49,140 --&gt; 00:06:50,140\nIt's really different.\n111\n00:06:50,140 --&gt; 00:06:55,180\nHow the hell evolution figured out that females would secrete nutrients from their chest skin and then infants would, like, completely insane.\n113\n00:06:59,260 --&gt; 00:07:03,060\nWe have like, whatever, 300 million years of evolution to get that.\n114\n00:07:03,060 --&gt; 00:07:07,020\nWe have this long dependency as mammals on the female body.\n115\n00:07:07,020 --&gt; 00:07:15,060\nAnd then as the brains are growing in primates, the big jump is to the genus homo, hominids, much bigger brains.\n117\n00:07:16,060 --&gt; 00:07:19,060\nAnd then you get to homo sapiens and homohydobragensis.\n118\n00:07:19,060 --&gt; 00:07:21,660\nWe have really big brains.\nAnd it's thought that the last part of that, the huge size, isn't just like, oh, man, the tool user, it's actually much more for social life.\n121\n00:07:29,660 --&gt; 00:07:30,820\nIt's for culture.\n122\n00:07:30,820 --&gt; 00:07:33,780\nWe have this incredible adaptation called culture.\n123\n00:07:33,780 --&gt; 00:07:39,260\nAnd it requires a large frontal cortex and a long, long period of learning in order to fill it in with these cultural skills.\n125\n00:07:41,620 --&gt; 00:07:45,020\nAnd is that long period of learning the thing we called childhood?\n126\n00:07:45,020 --&gt; 00:07:46,020\nExactly.\n127\n00:07:46,020 --&gt; 00:07:47,980\nYou once could have the basic motor skills down.\n128\n00:07:47,980 --&gt; 00:07:51,660\nThey love to run and jump and hide and practice avoiding predators.\n129\n00:07:51,660 --&gt; 00:07:52,660\nSo it's very physical.\n130\n00:07:52,660 --&gt; 00:07:53,660\nKids are very physical.\n131\n00:07:53,660 --&gt; 00:07:54,860\nThey want to play all the time.\n132\n00:07:54,860 --&gt; 00:07:58,460\nBut once they reach around age six or seven, now they really want to play in groups.\n133\n00:07:58,460 --&gt; 00:08:01,340\nThey're so exciting to play with another group of kids.\n134\n00:08:01,340 --&gt; 00:08:02,340\nAnd that's all over the world.\n135\n00:08:02,340 --&gt; 00:08:03,500\nYou travel anywhere in the world.\n136\n00:08:03,500 --&gt; 00:08:07,460\nYou'll find kids of that age, you know, five or six up through 10 or 12.\n137\n00:08:07,460 --&gt; 00:08:09,220\nThey're out playing in groups.\n138\n00:08:09,220 --&gt; 00:08:10,220\nThat's what they want to do.\n139\n00:08:10,220 --&gt; 00:08:11,540\nThat's how they learn best.\n140\n00:08:11,540 --&gt; 00:08:14,060\nYou know, and you asked me at the opening, what was my childhood like?\n141\n00:08:14,060 --&gt; 00:08:15,340\nYou know, it was like that.\n142\n00:08:15,340 --&gt; 00:08:18,340\nBut then in the 90s, we decided to change it.\n143\n00:08:18,340 --&gt; 00:08:20,780\nWe freaked out about child abduction.\n144\n00:08:20,780 --&gt; 00:08:23,100\nWe became incredibly overprotective.\n145\n00:08:23,100 --&gt; 00:08:25,620\nWe totally focused on college admissions.\n146\n00:08:25,620 --&gt; 00:08:29,620\nAnd you know, the point of childhood is to do well on the SAT and assemble a resume to get into college.\n148\n00:08:31,140 --&gt; 00:08:34,300\nAnd there's a graph in the book, 96 was the peak year of change.\n149\n00:08:34,300 --&gt; 00:08:38,540\nThat's the year that suddenly women began spending a lot more time with their kids and fathers did too.\n151\n00:08:39,540 --&gt; 00:08:41,180\nWhy did that happen?\n152\n00:08:41,180 --&gt; 00:08:46,500\nSo first there was a real crime wave and I was just listening to an episode about the 1970s.\n153\n00:08:46,500 --&gt; 00:08:49,460\nAnd I forgot how completely nuts everything was.\n154\n00:08:49,460 --&gt; 00:08:52,940\nI mean, there were serial killers biting off people's ears.\n155\n00:08:52,940 --&gt; 00:08:55,020\nYou know, there was a lot of craziness in mayhem.\n156\n00:08:55,020 --&gt; 00:08:58,740\nThere were a lot of terrorism and bombs, street crime, you know, things really did get more dangerous, especially in urban areas.\n158\n00:09:01,380 --&gt; 00:09:05,660\nBut you know, suburban areas like yours and mine were still quite safe for kids to be outside.\n159\n00:09:05,660 --&gt; 00:09:08,820\nBut fear began to spread in part through the media because, you know, when there were three networks, they didn't have a lot on child abductions.\n161\n00:09:11,540 --&gt; 00:09:15,300\nBut once you have cable networks, well now some of them are carrying, you know, there are like a hundred true child abductions every year in this country.\n163\n00:09:18,140 --&gt; 00:09:21,980\nIt's tiny, but you know, some of them get a huge amount of attention.\n164\n00:09:21,980 --&gt; 00:09:26,100\nThere was the milk cartons with this photos of missing kids.\n165\n00:09:26,100 --&gt; 00:09:30,720\nSo for a variety of reasons are thinking about childhood begins to change in the 80s, but kids lives don't change that much until the 90s.\n167\n00:09:33,900 --&gt; 00:09:38,420\nA lot of these trends, the overprotection started among more educated upper-class people.\n168\n00:09:38,420 --&gt; 00:09:43,320\nThey're the ones who began to do what the sociologist Annette LaRoe calls concerted cultivation parenting.\n170\n00:09:44,320 --&gt; 00:09:48,000\nYou know, I will shepherd you around to, you know, math lessons and Mandarin lessons and these things will make you Ivy League material.\n172\n00:09:50,980 --&gt; 00:09:52,660\nBut they've actually spread to everyone now.\n173\n00:09:52,660 --&gt; 00:09:58,660\nThere's another aspect to this that I think is under discussed, which is as people had fewer children, their obsession over those children got more intense.\n175\n00:10:03,020 --&gt; 00:10:05,700\nHow important of a factor is that?\n176\n00:10:05,700 --&gt; 00:10:06,700\nYes.\n177\n00:10:06,700 --&gt; 00:10:07,700\nThat is huge.\n178\n00:10:07,700 --&gt; 00:10:12,820\nThere are several like major sociological trends that drove this change of childhood.\n179\n00:10:12,820 --&gt; 00:10:14,780\nAnd I just talked about one, which is changing media.\n180\n00:10:14,780 --&gt; 00:10:17,540\nOh, in a second, a true rise in crime.\n181\n00:10:17,540 --&gt; 00:10:20,660\nThe third, I think, is prosperity and education.\n182\n00:10:20,660 --&gt; 00:10:24,880\nSo the normal human thing is you have lots of babies and some of them die on the way to adulthood.\n184\n00:10:25,880 --&gt; 00:10:27,900\nYou don't invest all that much in anyone.\n185\n00:10:27,900 --&gt; 00:10:29,180\nYou just have a lot of them.\n186\n00:10:29,180 --&gt; 00:10:31,660\nAnd as long as you have a lot of them, well, there are a lot of kids around.\n187\n00:10:31,660 --&gt; 00:10:34,100\nThey're all playing with each other and, you know, you've got a lot of work to do.\n188\n00:10:34,100 --&gt; 00:10:36,260\nYou're not going to be playing with them.\n189\n00:10:36,260 --&gt; 00:10:37,660\nLet them play with each other.\n190\n00:10:37,660 --&gt; 00:10:39,660\nAnd so people used to grow up with siblings.\n191\n00:10:39,660 --&gt; 00:10:43,780\nWell, you know, talk to people in China now, especially once they got the one child policy.\n192\n00:10:43,780 --&gt; 00:10:47,900\nThey got to the point of a while ago where you have one child with no aunts and uncles and four grandparents.\n194\n00:10:48,900 --&gt; 00:10:52,860\nYou have one child, two parents, four grandparents, all doting on this one child.\n195\n00:10:52,860 --&gt; 00:10:57,820\nAll of their hopes, genetic and cultural are invested in this one child.\n196\n00:10:57,820 --&gt; 00:11:00,780\nAnd especially in East Asian societies, which are very much test-based.\n197\n00:11:00,780 --&gt; 00:11:03,700\nYou know, they have this ancient meritocracy around tests.\n198\n00:11:03,700 --&gt; 00:11:05,380\nThere's a lot of pressure on the kid.\n199\n00:11:05,380 --&gt; 00:11:06,820\nMy wife is Korean American.\n200\n00:11:06,820 --&gt; 00:11:08,580\nWe've been to Korea together.\n201\n00:11:08,580 --&gt; 00:11:12,220\nAnd, you know, childhood in Korea is all about just practicing for college entrance exams.\n202\n00:11:12,220 --&gt; 00:11:13,460\nIt's really sad.\n203\n00:11:13,460 --&gt; 00:11:18,860\nBut so as a society modernizes, as women are, as everyone's wealthier, women are more educated, costs of living go up, for all these reasons, large families decline.\n205\n00:11:22,380 --&gt; 00:11:23,380\nAnd we have a large family.\n206\n00:11:23,380 --&gt; 00:11:24,380\nYou can't oversupervised.\n207\n00:11:24,380 --&gt; 00:11:27,540\nAnd you can expect the kids to look out for each other.\n208\n00:11:27,540 --&gt; 00:11:32,700\nAnd when you have two college educated parents and one child, boy, are they going to try to engineer the best outcome?\n210\n00:11:34,820 --&gt; 00:11:38,220\nSo for all these reasons, again, it's just the 70s, 80s, and into the 90s.\n211\n00:11:38,220 --&gt; 00:11:42,300\nJust huge sociological changes, huge changes in American family structure.\n212\n00:11:42,300 --&gt; 00:11:47,140\nAnd all of these contribute to the rewiring of childhood, away from free play and towards concerted cultivation, preparation for college.\n214\n00:11:50,500 --&gt; 00:11:55,740\nSo these fundamental changes begin happening in the 80s and then especially in the 90s, where we have fewer kids in the family, less unsupervised play, more fear in paranoia coming from the media and therefore to the parents.\n217\n00:12:03,860 --&gt; 00:12:06,140\nAnd then more helicopter parenting.\n218\n00:12:06,140 --&gt; 00:12:07,660\nCombine all of these for me.\n219\n00:12:07,660 --&gt; 00:12:10,620\nWhat do these do to kids?\n220\n00:12:10,620 --&gt; 00:12:13,100\nBefore the smartphone even enters the scene?\n221\n00:12:13,100 --&gt; 00:12:15,060\nSo two big things.\n222\n00:12:15,060 --&gt; 00:12:19,300\nOne is it deprives them of what they most need to develop anti-fragility.\n223\n00:12:19,300 --&gt; 00:12:22,500\nSo anti-fragility, hope is familiar to your listeners by now.\n224\n00:12:22,500 --&gt; 00:12:27,420\nIt's the concept that is from Nassim Taleb, my NYU colleague, it's the opposite of fragility.\n225\n00:12:27,420 --&gt; 00:12:30,260\nIt means that you actually need to get knocked around.\n226\n00:12:30,260 --&gt; 00:12:32,260\nYou need to have setbacks in order to get strong.\n227\n00:12:32,260 --&gt; 00:12:37,300\nAlso the immune system is the classic example if you protect your kids from bacteria, you're preventing the immune system from developing.\n229\n00:12:39,020 --&gt; 00:12:43,780\nIt needs bacteria, it needs to get ill in order to develop immunity.\n230\n00:12:43,780 --&gt; 00:12:49,340\nSo the vast over protection is very much like raising your kid in a germ-free bubble.\n231\n00:12:49,340 --&gt; 00:12:52,060\nYou are going to cause your kid to have autoimmune diseases.\n232\n00:12:52,060 --&gt; 00:12:56,820\nAnd I think depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and self-harm are sort of the psychiatric equivalence of autoimmune disease.\n234\n00:12:59,140 --&gt; 00:13:03,380\nThe other big thing is we raise them in an environment of fear.\n235\n00:13:03,380 --&gt; 00:13:05,300\nSo we teach them the world is dangerous.\n236\n00:13:05,300 --&gt; 00:13:08,220\nNow in fact, the world has gotten unbelievably safe.\n237\n00:13:08,220 --&gt; 00:13:12,460\nI mean, the death rate from all causes just keeps dropping and dropping, especially with the consumer revolution in the 60, 70s, 80s.\n239\n00:13:16,460 --&gt; 00:13:21,100\nThe odds of a kid dying today are tiny compared to 50 or 100 years ago.\n240\n00:13:21,100 --&gt; 00:13:23,860\nSo the world gets safer and safer, but we get more and more afraid of it, and we teach that to our kids.\n242\n00:13:25,180 --&gt; 00:13:30,140\nTo the point where our kids are told stranger danger, don't ever talk to strangers.\n243\n00:13:30,140 --&gt; 00:13:35,980\nNow yes, our kids should be wary if a stranger comes up to them and says, &quot;Oh, come with me, of course, that's terrible.&quot;\n245\n00:13:36,980 --&gt; 00:13:37,980\nRight.\n246\n00:13:37,980 --&gt; 00:13:41,460\nBut when you and I are growing up, if you need directions, you talk to a stranger.\n247\n00:13:41,460 --&gt; 00:13:42,660\nLike you say, &quot;Excuse me, sir.\n248\n00:13:42,660 --&gt; 00:13:43,860\nCan you tell me how to get to zone?&quot;\n249\n00:13:43,860 --&gt; 00:13:49,100\nSo there's a wonderful book, &quot;Parented Parenting&quot; by a British sociologist, Frank Verady.\n250\n00:13:49,100 --&gt; 00:13:54,460\nHe says, &quot;The center of all of this is the spectacular collapse of adult solidarity, which is a fancy way of saying, &quot;Adults used to kind of assume that we'd help each other out with our kids and that if your kids in trouble, and I'm there, I'll help them.&quot;\n253\n00:14:02,220 --&gt; 00:14:05,540\nThat's kind of what decent societies have always assumed.\n254\n00:14:05,540 --&gt; 00:14:11,020\nBut once we had all these satanic panics and sexual abuse scandals, and some were real, and many were not, we get the feeling that we can never trust any other adult.\n256\n00:14:16,140 --&gt; 00:14:18,300\nNo adult can ever talk to our kids.\n257\n00:14:18,300 --&gt; 00:14:21,300\nAnd so there's a general sense of paranoia about everyone.\n258\n00:14:21,300 --&gt; 00:14:25,860\nNow, if you raise your kids in the safest environments that have ever been, and then you send them to the colleges, universities which are like the socially safest environments that have ever been, but you tell them that everything is dangerous, everyone's out to get you, you can't succeed, there's so many obstacles.\n262\n00:14:38,740 --&gt; 00:14:44,420\nSo this is not this sort of paranoia, this negativity is just not a good way to raise kids that are going to become confident, competent, and capable.\n\n264\n00:14:47,940 --&gt; 00:14:53,300\nThere's a beautiful metaphor you use in the book where you compare the raising of resilient children to a reaction in trees that makes them strong, something I never heard of called &quot;stresswood.&quot;\n267\n00:14:58,620 --&gt; 00:15:03,620\nAnd here's what you write, &quot;Trees that are exposed to strong winds early in life become trees that can withstand even stronger winds when full grown.&quot;\n269\n00:15:07,540 --&gt; 00:15:11,980\nConversely, trees that are raised in a protected greenhouse sometimes fall over from their own weight before they reach maturity.\n271\n00:15:14,980 --&gt; 00:15:19,860\n&quot;Stresswood is a perfect metaphor for children who also need to experience frequent stressors in order to become strong adults.\n273\n00:15:22,580 --&gt; 00:15:28,540\nWhat are those healthy stressors that kids need to develop that they're no longer getting?&quot;\n274\n00:15:28,540 --&gt; 00:15:34,180\nIt's all the little small stuff that was unpleasant as a child, so it's being excluded, it's vital that kids be excluded.\n276\n00:15:36,100 --&gt; 00:15:37,260\nCan you imagine?\n277\n00:15:37,260 --&gt; 00:15:39,860\nSo your daughter is what, how old are you?\n278\n00:15:39,860 --&gt; 00:15:40,860\nTwo, three.\n279\n00:15:40,860 --&gt; 00:15:41,860\nYeah, she's less than two, yeah.\n280\n00:15:41,860 --&gt; 00:15:44,780\nWe're not at the excluding mean girls' phase yet.\n281\n00:15:44,780 --&gt; 00:15:47,740\nBut so suppose we'll get there.\n282\n00:15:47,740 --&gt; 00:15:49,540\nThat's right, you will.\n283\n00:15:49,540 --&gt; 00:15:52,740\nGiven that she's going to get there, if I gave you the option, I said, &quot;If you sign this deal, I can guarantee that she will never face exclusion before her 18th birthday.\n285\n00:15:57,900 --&gt; 00:15:58,900\nWould you sign it?&quot;\n286\n00:15:58,900 --&gt; 00:15:59,900\nNo.\n287\n00:15:59,900 --&gt; 00:16:00,900\nRight.\n288\n00:16:00,900 --&gt; 00:16:05,100\nBecause we know intuitively that they have to experience it.\n289\n00:16:05,100 --&gt; 00:16:08,740\nOtherwise, it's going to be devastating when they're 18.\n290\n00:16:08,740 --&gt; 00:16:10,940\nAnd it's the same thing for, let's say, losing.\n291\n00:16:10,940 --&gt; 00:16:14,900\nIt's very important that children lose a lot in competitive games.\n292\n00:16:14,900 --&gt; 00:16:17,700\nI remember when my kids were young, it was very painful for them to lose.\n293\n00:16:17,700 --&gt; 00:16:19,140\nThey would sometimes get upset.\n294\n00:16:19,140 --&gt; 00:16:21,900\nBut after a while, then they just, you know, then they get used to it.\n295\n00:16:21,900 --&gt; 00:16:25,820\nAnd now you can have a lot more fun because they know we're going to play 20 games and I'm going to lose a bunch of them and win a bunch of them.\n297\n00:16:28,260 --&gt; 00:16:34,020\nSo winning and losing, being excluded, certainly falling down and getting hurt and then getting hurt when there's no adult around.\n299\n00:16:35,340 --&gt; 00:16:39,140\nSo, you know, like I remember crashing on my bicycle and you have to kind of limp home and maybe the pedal is bent and but you get home and then you realize, oh, I can do that.\n301\n00:16:43,580 --&gt; 00:16:44,580\nI can get home.\n302\n00:16:44,580 --&gt; 00:16:47,100\nThere's many fascinating charts in this book.\n303\n00:16:47,100 --&gt; 00:16:52,900\nOne of those charts is a chart of hospital admissions for unintentional injuries of children between 2000 and 2018.\n305\n00:16:55,260 --&gt; 00:16:58,660\nAnd it shows just this unbelievably sharp decrease.\n306\n00:16:58,660 --&gt; 00:17:02,780\nAnd you also add in the book and this is something that I think will be familiar to many listeners that teens and young adults just aren't experimenting as much.\n308\n00:17:05,980 --&gt; 00:17:07,260\nThey don't drink as much.\n309\n00:17:07,260 --&gt; 00:17:08,740\nThey're having less sex.\n310\n00:17:08,740 --&gt; 00:17:13,900\nAnd I think someone might see these figures, a decrease in unintentional injuries, a decrease in drinking, a decrease in sex and say, what's the problem?\n312\n00:17:18,340 --&gt; 00:17:23,060\nYou know, less car accidents, fewer hospital admissions, isn't that a good thing?\n313\n00:17:23,060 --&gt; 00:17:24,260\nWhat do you say to those people?\n314\n00:17:24,260 --&gt; 00:17:29,060\nOh, what I said is that is if, you know, if everything else were equal and we could have fewer boys with broken arms, I would say, of course, we want fewer boys for your kids with broken arms.\n317\n00:17:34,820 --&gt; 00:17:38,140\nBut here's, let me find the graph because this is one of my favorite graphs too.\n318\n00:17:38,140 --&gt; 00:17:40,500\nIt was one of the most shocking.\n319\n00:17:40,500 --&gt; 00:17:46,420\nSo the CDC gives us data on hospital admissions for various causes and one is unintentional injuries.\n320\n00:17:46,420 --&gt; 00:17:47,940\nSo this is not self harm.\n321\n00:17:47,940 --&gt; 00:17:51,300\nYou fall down, you know, you fall on your bicycle, whatever.\n322\n00:17:51,300 --&gt; 00:17:54,140\nAnd who do you think of all the ages and of the two sexes?\n323\n00:17:54,140 --&gt; 00:17:57,380\nWho do you think has by far the highest rates of injuries, you know, broken arms?\n324\n00:17:57,380 --&gt; 00:17:58,380\nWho would it be?\n325\n00:17:58,380 --&gt; 00:17:59,380\nTeenage boys, yeah.\n326\n00:17:59,380 --&gt; 00:18:00,380\nTeenage boys.\n327\n00:18:00,380 --&gt; 00:18:01,460\nAnd that used to be true.\n328\n00:18:01,460 --&gt; 00:18:06,220\nAnd what is stunning is that when you see all of the age groups and both genders next to each other and you see that, you know, there has been an overall drop in injuries for most age groups, but the teenage boys and then also the boys in their 20s used to be much higher than the others.\n332\n00:18:17,700 --&gt; 00:18:23,700\nAnd now they have dropped so fast and so far, especially since 2012 that teenage boys in America today are slightly less likely to get injured than 50 year old men back and they're slightly less likely to get injured than teenage girls were 15 years ago.\n335\n00:18:34,660 --&gt; 00:18:39,060\nAnd the reason is that boys are not doing anything that could break their arm.\n336\n00:18:39,060 --&gt; 00:18:43,360\nYou come home after school, you're on your screen, you're on your, you plug into your game console, yeah.\n338\n00:18:44,360 --&gt; 00:18:45,460\nYeah, that's right.\n339\n00:18:45,460 --&gt; 00:18:49,020\nSo, you know, if someone says, oh, you know, it's great that they're not getting injured, I would say, well, okay, you know, look at the suicide rate.\n341\n00:18:51,500 --&gt; 00:18:54,820\nThe injury rate is down, but the suicide rate is way, way up.\n342\n00:18:54,820 --&gt; 00:18:57,820\nAnd you know, we'll get into the details more about what's happening to boys.\n343\n00:18:57,820 --&gt; 00:19:04,620\nBut there's a pervasive feeling of uselessness, of inability to do anything that matters, loneliness.\n345\n00:19:06,300 --&gt; 00:19:12,460\nSo yeah, we have kids with unbroken skeletons sitting there feeling disconnected, ripe for recruitment by all kinds of politically extreme organizations.\n347\n00:19:16,660 --&gt; 00:19:18,580\nThis is not a good trade off.\n348\n00:19:18,580 --&gt; 00:19:24,460\nOne thing you talk about in your book that really interested me is the cycle of incompetence that we have created in children.\n350\n00:19:26,780 --&gt; 00:19:28,700\nCan you say a little bit about that?\n351\n00:19:28,700 --&gt; 00:19:33,780\nSo because we came to see our children as vulnerable or fragile rather than antifragile, if you see your kids as antifragile, say, go out and play.\n353\n00:19:36,340 --&gt; 00:19:40,620\nAnd if they say, oh, it's cold, you say, you know, tough it out or if they fall, you're okay, go back.\n355\n00:19:41,620 --&gt; 00:19:43,380\nSo that's what you would do if you think kids are antifragile.\n356\n00:19:43,380 --&gt; 00:19:47,060\nIf you think kids are fragile, you're going to never leave them unsupervised, which means they never learn to work things out for themselves.\n358\n00:19:49,500 --&gt; 00:19:52,060\nAnd you're going to swoop in at this first sign of trouble.\n359\n00:19:52,060 --&gt; 00:19:53,060\nAnd so what happens?\n360\n00:19:53,060 --&gt; 00:19:56,300\nIf you assume that they're incompetent and fragile, then they don't have the experience that would make them competent and non-fragile.\n362\n00:19:59,540 --&gt; 00:20:02,620\nSo you're actually making them incompetent and fragile.\n363\n00:20:02,620 --&gt; 00:20:06,220\nAnd then you look at these incompetent fragile, you know, fifth graders.\n364\n00:20:06,220 --&gt; 00:20:07,940\nAnd then you say, well, how can we trust you?\n365\n00:20:07,940 --&gt; 00:20:09,780\nI can't let you walk to the store.\n366\n00:20:09,780 --&gt; 00:20:10,780\nWhat if you get lost?\n367\n00:20:10,780 --&gt; 00:20:12,820\nIt's a cycle, a vicious cycle.\n368\n00:20:12,820 --&gt; 00:20:14,260\nAnd so that's what we have to break.\n369\n00:20:14,260 --&gt; 00:20:15,260\nOkay.\n370\n00:20:15,260 --&gt; 00:20:16,780\nSo let's get to the phones.\n371\n00:20:16,780 --&gt; 00:20:22,380\nThe next big shift in childhood was not as many people might believe when the first smartphone dropped around 2007.\n373\n00:20:24,340 --&gt; 00:20:31,500\nBut you argue it's when the iPhone four dropped in 2010 and kids mental health just plummets.\n374\n00:20:31,500 --&gt; 00:20:36,940\nWhat was special about the iPhone four and about the iteration of that specific device that really sent kids over the edge?\n376\n00:20:39,260 --&gt; 00:20:42,860\nSo that's the first smartphone that has a front-facing camera.\n377\n00:20:42,860 --&gt; 00:20:46,460\nAnd that means that now all the photos kids are taking of others.\n378\n00:20:46,460 --&gt; 00:20:48,700\nNow they start taking more about themselves.\n379\n00:20:48,700 --&gt; 00:20:52,580\nBut I don't want to say that that was the thing that did it, rather what I want to say is there are about three or four different technological innovations that all came together around then.\n382\n00:20:57,980 --&gt; 00:21:02,400\nSo if a kid got an iPhone in 2007, very few did, it was great.\n383\n00:21:02,400 --&gt; 00:21:04,300\nIt was not harmful in any way.\n384\n00:21:04,300 --&gt; 00:21:08,220\nIt was, as Steve Jobs said, Apple is releasing three products today.\n385\n00:21:08,220 --&gt; 00:21:13,820\nA phone, an iPod, and was an internet browser, was the third or whatever.\n386\n00:21:13,820 --&gt; 00:21:15,980\nBut it's three products all in one.\n387\n00:21:15,980 --&gt; 00:21:17,540\nAnd then there's also a flashlight.\n388\n00:21:17,540 --&gt; 00:21:20,660\nIt was an amazing, amazing digital Swiss army knife.\n389\n00:21:20,660 --&gt; 00:21:21,660\nAnd there were no apps.\n390\n00:21:21,660 --&gt; 00:21:23,620\nThere were the apps from Apple, but there was no app store.\n391\n00:21:23,620 --&gt; 00:21:25,460\nBut then two critical things happen, right?\n392\n00:21:25,460 --&gt; 00:21:27,940\nYou have the app store launching in 2008.\n393\n00:21:27,940 --&gt; 00:21:34,020\nAnd then in 2009, Facebook introducing the like button and Twitter introducing retweets.\n394\n00:21:34,020 --&gt; 00:21:35,020\nThat's right.\n395\n00:21:35,020 --&gt; 00:21:39,980\nSo what I want to get across to listeners is that the internet came in in two waves.\n396\n00:21:39,980 --&gt; 00:21:43,020\nAnd you know, you millennials surfed the first wave and it was great fun.\n397\n00:21:43,020 --&gt; 00:21:47,820\nYou had AOL, you had web browsers, you know, you had all kinds of, it was like a world opening up.\n399\n00:21:48,820 --&gt; 00:21:52,540\nI've seen no evidence to suggest that there are flip phones, harmed them.\n400\n00:21:52,540 --&gt; 00:21:54,380\nSo what happens in the end of 2000s?\n401\n00:21:54,380 --&gt; 00:21:55,380\nIt's the things you said.\n402\n00:21:55,380 --&gt; 00:21:59,380\nThe iPhone comes out with a touch swipe, you know, interface much more engaging, which is good, you think you get social media becomes much more viral in 2009.\n404\n00:22:05,260 --&gt; 00:22:09,620\nAnd so before then they were called social networking systems and you put up your page and you linked other people's page that you connect.\n406\n00:22:11,620 --&gt; 00:22:15,860\nBut then as they put in the like button, the retweet button, it's much more about virality.\n407\n00:22:15,860 --&gt; 00:22:17,540\nThey have much more information on each user.\n408\n00:22:17,540 --&gt; 00:22:19,340\nThey can use algorithms much more.\n409\n00:22:19,340 --&gt; 00:22:20,700\nIt's all about the news feed.\n410\n00:22:20,700 --&gt; 00:22:24,900\nSo social media fundamentally changes and becomes much more about performance, which opens up much more room for cruelty, mob interactions, cancel culture, all the craziness and universities could not have happened if there wasn't the retweet button and the share button.\n413\n00:22:35,580 --&gt; 00:22:38,260\nThe internet wasn't as super viral as it became.\n414\n00:22:38,260 --&gt; 00:22:39,460\nSo you have that coming in.\n415\n00:22:39,460 --&gt; 00:22:41,500\nAnother big one is high speed internet.\n416\n00:22:41,500 --&gt; 00:22:47,340\nSo in 2007 and even all the way up to 2010, very few kids have an unlimited data plan.\n417\n00:22:47,340 --&gt; 00:22:50,460\nYou know, back then you had to pay for texts like every text, you know, is going to cost you a few pennies.\n419\n00:22:51,740 --&gt; 00:22:56,780\nSo you had a limit, your consumption and your sending and it wasn't fun to, you know, just sit there waiting for slow internet to load.\n421\n00:22:59,020 --&gt; 00:23:03,380\nSo that's 2010 and that's when the front-facing camera comes out and that's when Instagram comes out, although it's not popular till 2012.\n423\n00:23:05,940 --&gt; 00:23:10,260\n2012 is basically the last year before the epidemic begins.\n424\n00:23:10,260 --&gt; 00:23:13,980\nSome of the numbers go up in 2012 but for the most part it's kind of, that's the elbow and it's really 2013 that all the numbers of pathology begin to rise and rise very quickly and especially for girls.\n427\n00:23:21,180 --&gt; 00:23:27,300\nSo my argument in the book is that the first wave of the internet with computers and web browsers, that was not harmful and the millennials, you know, you guys got through it in time.\n429\n00:23:31,620 --&gt; 00:23:34,220\nYou went through puberty in time.\n430\n00:23:34,220 --&gt; 00:23:39,780\nBut Gen Z, if you're born in 1996, you might have gotten a smartphone in middle school when you were like 15, 16, you might have gotten on Instagram and you went through puberty, especially if you're born, say, by 2000.\n433\n00:23:46,460 --&gt; 00:23:52,620\nYou went through puberty, posting photos, selfies and then wait anxiously for people to comment and then you spent a lot of your day tracking down who like this photo, what did they say?\n435\n00:23:57,540 --&gt; 00:23:58,700\nWhy didn't they like this photo?\n436\n00:23:58,700 --&gt; 00:24:00,500\nWhy do they like someone else's photo?\n437\n00:24:00,500 --&gt; 00:24:06,060\nAnd so especially for girls, it's a fundamental shift in consciousness away from interacting with other kids and toward managing your brand all day long.\n439\n00:24:10,540 --&gt; 00:24:13,780\nAnd this is a sick thing to do to kids, especially in middle school.\n440\n00:24:13,780 --&gt; 00:24:19,100\nI think it's pretty obvious to any adult who has a phone and finds themselves scrolling Instagram or Twitter late into the night that it's bad for any human being, let alone kids.\n442\n00:24:25,140 --&gt; 00:24:31,340\nBut you write in the book that there are four specific harms that began to emerge for teenagers.\n\n443\n00:24:31,340 --&gt; 00:24:33,460\nOr let's say middle school teenagers.\n444\n00:24:33,460 --&gt; 00:24:35,660\nOne is social deprivation.\n445\n00:24:35,660 --&gt; 00:24:37,660\nTwo is sleep deprivation.\n446\n00:24:37,660 --&gt; 00:24:39,900\nThree is attention fragmentation.\n447\n00:24:39,900 --&gt; 00:24:41,500\nAnd four is addiction.\n448\n00:24:41,500 --&gt; 00:24:46,580\nSo I would love for us to take each of those interns beginning with social deprivation.\n449\n00:24:46,580 --&gt; 00:24:51,580\nThe average amount of time that kids between the ages of 15 and 24 years old spent with their friends each day went from about two and a half hours in 2003 to just barely more than 40 minutes in 2019.\n452\n00:25:00,540 --&gt; 00:25:04,340\nAnd many people are communicating with their friends only through the phone.\n453\n00:25:04,340 --&gt; 00:25:09,940\nYou've also seen that kids have seen a steady drop in the number of friends they have since the late 90s.\n455\n00:25:11,940 --&gt; 00:25:17,940\nMeantime the percentage of kids who report feeling lonely has increased since the late 90s.\n456\n00:25:17,940 --&gt; 00:25:19,420\nIt's like such a fundamental question.\n457\n00:25:19,420 --&gt; 00:25:21,220\nAll this feels weird asking it.\n458\n00:25:21,220 --&gt; 00:25:27,700\nBut what are kids losing without friends without that personal interaction and what negative habits are they replacing time with friends with?\n460\n00:25:30,860 --&gt; 00:25:31,860\nYeah.\n461\n00:25:31,860 --&gt; 00:25:36,820\nSo if you think about, what if we were to replace all of the food that kids eat with a science-based formula that had the right amount of starch and sugar and protein and all that, would that work?\n464\n00:25:43,300 --&gt; 00:25:47,340\nNo, it wouldn't because there's so many phytonutrients, so many things we need from plants.\n465\n00:25:47,340 --&gt; 00:25:54,140\nYou can't just take away all of our evolved programming for digestion and metabolism and swap in some radically new simple science formula.\n467\n00:25:57,580 --&gt; 00:26:02,460\nAnd in the same way, when kids started spending all this time on these devices, I didn't know that it was going to be bad.\n469\n00:26:03,460 --&gt; 00:26:06,740\nI thought, actually, I remember thinking, you know, it seems weird to me.\n470\n00:26:06,740 --&gt; 00:26:11,460\nTo tweet about the hamburger that you just had and then have 25 people comment on your tweet.\n472\n00:26:12,460 --&gt; 00:26:16,180\nIt seems kind of stupid to me, but maybe it's like hyper-sociality.\n473\n00:26:16,180 --&gt; 00:26:20,260\nI remember thinking around 2010, 2012, like young people to death, they might actually come out super social, so much social stimulation.\n475\n00:26:22,620 --&gt; 00:26:25,220\nIt might actually be better than what we had before.\n476\n00:26:25,220 --&gt; 00:26:26,660\nAnd that was a theoretical possibility.\n477\n00:26:26,660 --&gt; 00:26:28,660\nIt's one that has radically failed to materialize.\n478\n00:26:28,660 --&gt; 00:26:30,780\nIn fact, the opposite has materialized.\n479\n00:26:30,780 --&gt; 00:26:33,620\nThe more time kids spend doing this, the more lonely they are.\n480\n00:26:33,620 --&gt; 00:26:37,380\nThe more time kids spend doing this, the more likely out-of-cub themselves.\n481\n00:26:37,380 --&gt; 00:26:42,380\nWhat I think is happening is that real world interactions have a few features that are part of our evolutionary history and virtual interactions lack those features.\n483\n00:26:46,700 --&gt; 00:26:48,700\nThe most obvious one is embodiment.\n484\n00:26:48,700 --&gt; 00:26:51,700\nIf you look at chimpanzees, they all groom each other a lot.\n485\n00:26:51,700 --&gt; 00:26:56,420\nThere's a lot of interesting speculation about, since humans don't groom, which is a huge, a major, major social interaction for all the other primates is grooming.\n487\n00:27:00,380 --&gt; 00:27:04,740\nWe don't groom physically, but we do groom with gossip, at least that was Rob and Dunn Bar's theory.\n489\n00:27:05,740 --&gt; 00:27:08,100\nYou might say, &quot;Oh, well, social media is great for gossip.\n490\n00:27:08,100 --&gt; 00:27:09,540\nYou can gossip all day long.&quot;\n491\n00:27:09,540 --&gt; 00:27:11,020\nIt's not the same.\n492\n00:27:11,020 --&gt; 00:27:14,860\nFirst of all, we are still embodied creatures, and that is why I think we do like to touch and hug and things like that.\n494\n00:27:16,980 --&gt; 00:27:19,340\nVirtual interactions deprive you of embodiment.\n495\n00:27:19,340 --&gt; 00:27:21,940\nVirtual interactions are usually asynchronous.\n496\n00:27:21,940 --&gt; 00:27:25,060\nZoom call, a phone call, those are synchronous.\n497\n00:27:25,060 --&gt; 00:27:27,940\nI talk, you talk, we have a sense of turn-taking.\n498\n00:27:27,940 --&gt; 00:27:33,740\nMost of the kids' interaction is posting and commenting and emojis.\n499\n00:27:33,740 --&gt; 00:27:34,740\nThat's asynchronous.\n500\n00:27:34,740 --&gt; 00:27:37,900\nYou don't have the same sense of being in sync with another human being.\n501\n00:27:37,900 --&gt; 00:27:41,020\nYou're much more off in your own pod.\n502\n00:27:41,020 --&gt; 00:27:46,340\nA third one is the frequency of one to many communications.\n503\n00:27:46,340 --&gt; 00:27:47,820\nKids really need a small group.\n504\n00:27:47,820 --&gt; 00:27:48,820\nThey need a best friend.\n505\n00:27:48,820 --&gt; 00:27:50,980\nThey need a group of three or four friends.\n506\n00:27:50,980 --&gt; 00:27:55,660\nKids don't need to be on a soapbox, speaking to thousands of people and waiting for thousands of people to judge them.\n508\n00:27:56,860 --&gt; 00:28:01,860\nThat's just a terrible thing to do to children, but these new social media platforms do that.\n509\n00:28:01,860 --&gt; 00:28:06,860\nThe final difference is that if you get a conflict with a kid in your class, you can't just delete them or block them.\n511\n00:28:09,580 --&gt; 00:28:13,180\nYou actually either have to work it out or you're going to have to suffer for a long time with this strain relationship.\n513\n00:28:14,940 --&gt; 00:28:18,620\nThe real world forces you to practice working out relationships.\n514\n00:28:18,620 --&gt; 00:28:20,340\nThat's practice for a democratic society.\n515\n00:28:20,340 --&gt; 00:28:25,380\nAll of this is practice for being self-governing in a democratic society.\n516\n00:28:25,380 --&gt; 00:28:31,860\nWhen kids lose almost all of that and get it replaced with virtual interactions, it's like they're losing all the nutrients.\n518\n00:28:33,340 --&gt; 00:28:35,820\nIt's like we're giving them just white rice to eat.\n519\n00:28:35,820 --&gt; 00:28:38,140\nWhite rice has plenty of calories, just eat white rice.\n520\n00:28:38,140 --&gt; 00:28:40,300\nYou're going to be deficient in almost everything.\n521\n00:28:40,300 --&gt; 00:28:44,420\nThat's what we've done by swapping in virtual sociality for real sociality.\n522\n00:28:44,420 --&gt; 00:28:48,420\nThat's why the loneliness statistics, all the questions on monitoring the future about sometimes I feel lonely.\n524\n00:28:49,940 --&gt; 00:28:51,660\nMy life has no point.\n525\n00:28:51,660 --&gt; 00:28:54,140\nAll these questions, it's like a hockey stick.\n526\n00:28:54,140 --&gt; 00:28:56,780\nThey're flat until 2012.\n527\n00:28:56,780 --&gt; 00:29:02,500\nOnce kids are moving on to Instagram and other platforms, boom, everything explodes.\n528\n00:29:02,500 --&gt; 00:29:04,700\nSo that's social deprivation.\n529\n00:29:04,700 --&gt; 00:29:07,900\nLet's go to the next topic, which is sleep deprivation.\n530\n00:29:07,900 --&gt; 00:29:13,700\nSo sleep for everyone, but especially for teens, has gone down in the last decade.\n531\n00:29:13,700 --&gt; 00:29:19,340\nNearly half of eighth, tenth, and twelfth grade boys are getting less than seven hours of sleep,\n532\n00:29:19,340 --&gt; 00:29:23,940\nwhich is pretty astonishing considering how much sleep your body needs to get in those critical years of puberty.\n534\n00:29:26,140 --&gt; 00:29:29,820\nAnd these percentages jump significantly in the early 2010s.\n535\n00:29:29,820 --&gt; 00:29:35,740\nAnd you directly connect this to kids staying up late at night looking at their phones.\n536\n00:29:35,740 --&gt; 00:29:43,580\nTalk to me about why sleep deprivation is such a serious public health consideration and the effects that it has on the mental health and even the physical well-being of kids.\n538\n00:29:48,820 --&gt; 00:29:53,900\nSo the basic data on sleep amount, there was a substantial drop in the 90s.\n539\n00:29:53,900 --&gt; 00:29:58,700\nI don't know if that was television, cable TV, the internet, just a lot more stuff to look at late at night.\n541\n00:29:59,700 --&gt; 00:30:02,900\nAnd then it kind of levels off in the early 2000s and then it begins dropping again in the 2010s.\n543\n00:30:03,900 --&gt; 00:30:08,420\nNow, as for why sleep is important, your body does all kinds of biological repair processes.\n544\n00:30:08,420 --&gt; 00:30:12,740\nOn your brain, I wish to God I had gotten more sleep that I'd taken it more seriously.\n545\n00:30:12,740 --&gt; 00:30:14,260\nIt helps the brain regenerate.\n546\n00:30:14,260 --&gt; 00:30:16,540\nThe deep sleep is when you flush out broken proteins.\n547\n00:30:16,540 --&gt; 00:30:19,740\nThere's all sorts of things that need to happen in sleep.\n548\n00:30:19,740 --&gt; 00:30:23,620\nAnd teens need a lot of it eight or nine hours depending on the age.\n549\n00:30:23,620 --&gt; 00:30:28,020\nAnd if they're getting less than eight hours, they're not letting their brain and body regenerated.\n550\n00:30:28,020 --&gt; 00:30:33,140\nIt has extraordinary effects then on mood and concentration the next day.\n551\n00:30:33,140 --&gt; 00:30:39,140\nAnd so if we want our kids to go to school and have a good time with their friends and learn from their teachers, I think that pretty much is what we all want for our kids when they go to school.\n554\n00:30:43,540 --&gt; 00:30:47,260\nBut if they don't get enough sleep, they're going to be crankier, more irritable and anxious.\n555\n00:30:47,260 --&gt; 00:30:50,780\nTheir social relationships will worsen and they won't be able to pay attention.\n556\n00:30:50,780 --&gt; 00:30:52,060\nThey won't learn as much.\n557\n00:30:52,060 --&gt; 00:30:56,220\nIt's not a coincidence that we had 50 years of educational progress when you look at the NAEP, the National Educational Assessment.\n559\n00:30:59,020 --&gt; 00:31:05,860\n50 years of slow but steady progress in how much our kids know in this country until 2012.\n560\n00:31:05,860 --&gt; 00:31:07,180\nAnd then it begins to drop.\n561\n00:31:07,180 --&gt; 00:31:09,820\nAnd everyone says like, oh, look, COVID, look what COVID did.\n562\n00:31:09,820 --&gt; 00:31:14,700\nAnd it's true that keeping kids out of school, COVID restrictions really did damage kids learning.\n563\n00:31:14,700 --&gt; 00:31:19,060\nAnd you see a COVID drop, but the drop actually began after 2012.\n564\n00:31:19,060 --&gt; 00:31:24,140\nSo it's just insane that if we want our kids to grow physically healthy, have good, friendly relationships and learn, then if they're not getting enough sleep, all three, all three of those goals are compromised.\n567\n00:31:30,740 --&gt; 00:31:37,100\nYou write that in 2022, one third of teens said they were on one of the major social media sites almost constantly.\n569\n00:31:40,380 --&gt; 00:31:44,700\nAnd you see this, I feel this in myself as an adult whose brain came online before the great re-riaring, I feel the way that these devices and platforms have majorly harmed my ability to focus the way that a distraction, something more exciting, something more enticing and it's just one swipe away.\n\n573\n00:32:00,500 --&gt; 00:32:06,580\nTell us about how social media, the phones, but social media specifically has affected kids' ability to focus deeply, both at school and in other areas of life.\n575\n00:32:12,420 --&gt; 00:32:16,580\nThe brain grows very quickly in the first few years of life and then it actually slows down a lot.\n577\n00:32:17,740 --&gt; 00:32:19,700\nAnd from then on, it's not so much growth.\n578\n00:32:19,700 --&gt; 00:32:26,020\nIt's re-riaring, it's neurons connecting, it synapses forming, it's neurons fading away, if they're not used.\n580\n00:32:27,180 --&gt; 00:32:31,500\nSo there's a lot of re-wiring going on and that speeds up during puberty, especially early puberty around age 11 or 12 to around 15, 16 is a huge amount of change as the brain basically sort of like a caterpillar turning into a butterfly.\n583\n00:32:40,900 --&gt; 00:32:45,540\nYou have the young form of a human brain kind of rewires now that it's learned culture, it sort of rewires to lock down into the format of an American or a sweet or whatever.\n585\n00:32:52,180 --&gt; 00:32:55,900\nAnd this is exactly the period, unfortunately, when we put our kids on social media and let random weirdos on the internet control how the brain is rewiring.\n587\n00:32:59,860 --&gt; 00:33:03,260\nOne of the main things that is happening is in the prefrontal cortex, that's the last part to really go through the change, which is the seat of executive function that is\n589\n00:33:06,980 --&gt; 00:33:12,540\nthe ability to formulate a goal, figure out the means to achieve the goal, and then execute the plan to achieve the goal.\n591\n00:33:14,340 --&gt; 00:33:18,100\nSo if you want to do your homework, I want to watch this TV show at 10 o'clock tonight, so I have an hour, I better do my homework, I have one hour, kids struggle to do that, especially if you don't love doing your homework, it's going to take concentration and willpower to stay on task. But what happens?\n596\n00:33:29,060 --&gt; 00:33:33,460\nYou have an infinite number of really fun digital experiences just waiting for you if you touch the right buttons, but it's much more than that because you don't have to touch the right buttons.\n599\n00:33:37,660 --&gt; 00:33:41,820\nThe pop-ups are going to be popping up saying, &quot;Come play, come out, come look what someone just said about you.&quot;\n601\n00:33:43,420 --&gt; 00:33:48,500\nSo they're getting, I think on average now, 250 notifications a day is what American teens now get.\n603\n00:33:49,500 --&gt; 00:33:52,420\nThat's 250 times a day that their attention is interrupted.\n604\n00:33:52,420 --&gt; 00:33:54,540\nMost of them don't put it on a focus mode.\n605\n00:33:54,540 --&gt; 00:33:58,060\nThey just take it as normal, that any company that wants to take some of their attention can just take it.\n607\n00:33:59,340 --&gt; 00:34:04,820\nSo it was always hard for teens to focus and do their homework or do anything, but doing that gives you practice in doing it and if you do it repeatedly, you're actually helping your brain to develop good executive function.\n610\n00:34:12,980 --&gt; 00:34:16,540\nSo what would happen if you have a teen who never gets to practice that they literally never get an hour without an interruption? I think it could lead to permanent decrements in their ability to function as an adult.\n613\n00:34:23,940 --&gt; 00:34:29,940\nAnd is the average American, let's just say, 7th, 8th, 9th grader, having their phone in their pocket with them at school as it's pinging these notifications?\n615\n00:34:35,260 --&gt; 00:34:38,820\nYes, the great majority of schools say that they have a cell phone bill.\n616\n00:34:38,820 --&gt; 00:34:40,060\nIt's complete bullshit.\n617\n00:34:40,060 --&gt; 00:34:44,700\nAll they mean is, &quot;Oh, our rule is you're not allowed to take out your phone during class unless your teacher asks you to.&quot;\n619\n00:34:46,460 --&gt; 00:34:47,700\nThat's the rule.\n620\n00:34:47,700 --&gt; 00:34:51,780\nAnd what that means is that kids have to make some effort to hide their phone use.\n621\n00:34:51,780 --&gt; 00:34:55,460\nThey have to at least sit in the back row where they can't be seen or they just put in a book.\n623\n00:34:56,460 --&gt; 00:35:01,960\nBut if the kids put it this way, if any kids in your class are texting during the school day, then you have to check your texts.\n625\n00:35:05,060 --&gt; 00:35:09,660\nOtherwise, at lunch, you're going to be the only one who doesn't know the thing that so and so said, which everyone is laughing at.\n627\n00:35:11,700 --&gt; 00:35:14,380\nYou don't care if the teacher is mad at you, but you really don't want to be humiliated in front of your friends by being out of the loop.\n629\n00:35:17,020 --&gt; 00:35:19,780\nSo as long as anyone is texting, they're going to check their phone.\n630\n00:35:19,780 --&gt; 00:35:22,780\nThey're going to check their texts and social media dramas.\n631\n00:35:22,780 --&gt; 00:35:23,780\nAnd they do.\n632\n00:35:23,780 --&gt; 00:35:28,020\nThat's time you're talking to any group of young people, 45 minutes in, ask them, how many of you have actually already checked your phone while I was speaking?\n634\n00:35:30,660 --&gt; 00:35:32,740\nHow many of you do this typically during a class?\n635\n00:35:32,740 --&gt; 00:35:34,300\nOr almost everybody?\n636\n00:35:34,300 --&gt; 00:35:38,540\nSo I think it's completely insane that we allow phones in school.\n637\n00:35:38,540 --&gt; 00:35:41,620\nWe wouldn't let them bring their television sets into school and watch television during class.\n639\n00:35:42,620 --&gt; 00:35:44,140\nWhy do we let them have their phones?\n640\n00:35:44,140 --&gt; 00:35:45,740\nIt's just distracting.\n641\n00:35:45,740 --&gt; 00:35:50,460\nThe word addiction, John, as you know, gets thrown around a lot in our culture.\n642\n00:35:50,460 --&gt; 00:35:52,300\nSometimes I think it's sort of overused.\n643\n00:35:52,300 --&gt; 00:35:55,100\nBut would you argue that social media is a true addiction?\n644\n00:35:55,100 --&gt; 00:35:56,100\nAnd why?\n645\n00:35:56,100 --&gt; 00:35:57,100\nYeah.\n646\n00:35:57,100 --&gt; 00:36:00,740\nSo here I'll have to respect the term concept creep, which you referred to.\n647\n00:36:00,740 --&gt; 00:36:03,660\nAnd in the calling of the American mind, Greg and I said that addiction is one of those terms that has spread out.\n649\n00:36:05,260 --&gt; 00:36:09,660\nSo no, I would not call anything an addiction, unless you're very careful about it.\n650\n00:36:09,660 --&gt; 00:36:13,460\nI also know that in the addiction research literature, there's a big debate about this and some of them say, no, we shouldn't call it addiction.\n652\n00:36:16,420 --&gt; 00:36:20,740\nNow as far as I'm concerned, gambling is an addiction for many people.\n653\n00:36:20,740 --&gt; 00:36:24,300\nAnd if you watch someone who is a gambling addiction, they're pulling the slot, they get into a zone, they lose track of time, their life sucks, they hate their life, but for those two hours, they don't feel the pain.\n656\n00:36:30,460 --&gt; 00:36:32,820\nAnd that's why they keep doing it and that makes their life worse.\n657\n00:36:32,820 --&gt; 00:36:35,340\nSo I'm willing to call that an addiction.\n658\n00:36:35,340 --&gt; 00:36:40,260\nAnd I think many addiction researchers are some, not most, but some kids have that with social media.\n660\n00:36:41,260 --&gt; 00:36:44,740\nThe better term to use is what they call problematic use.\n661\n00:36:44,740 --&gt; 00:36:50,140\nSo if you're spending four hours a day on Instagram, but you're still seeing your friends, you're still getting good grades in class, it's a time suck, but you can't say that it's in your fearing with basically love and work of the two areas that psychologists look at love and work, basically relationships and either work or school work.\n665\n00:37:03,820 --&gt; 00:37:07,580\nSo if you're doing fine on those, well, okay, then maybe it's your choice.\n666\n00:37:07,580 --&gt; 00:37:13,060\nBut wherever we look, the numbers come up between 5 and 15% as having problematic use.\n667\n00:37:13,060 --&gt; 00:37:15,020\nSo video games are tremendous fun.\n668\n00:37:15,020 --&gt; 00:37:18,100\nBoys really defend them and they don't want them taken away.\n669\n00:37:18,100 --&gt; 00:37:23,060\nBut it turns out that 5 to 15% have problematic use where they can't stop.\n670\n00:37:23,060 --&gt; 00:37:24,940\nThey're surly with their parents.\n671\n00:37:24,940 --&gt; 00:37:28,740\nIf they're deprived for a day or two, they get really surly and maybe even aggressive.\n672\n00:37:28,740 --&gt; 00:37:33,140\nIt's interfering with their ability to, with their school work, with their ability to function with friends.\n674\n00:37:34,140 --&gt; 00:37:37,540\nSo people say, oh, you know, my kids are fine or you know, most kids are doing, okay, sure, most are.\n676\n00:37:38,540 --&gt; 00:37:42,500\nBut can you think of any consumer product in the world where if there was a one in ten chance that your kid uses it, they're going to get hooked and have problematic behavior to the point where it's going to interfere with other life domains.\n679\n00:37:50,540 --&gt; 00:37:53,940\nAnd if they do it for two or three hours a day over many years, it could change the brain development.\n681\n00:37:54,940 --&gt; 00:37:58,060\nIs there any other product that we would ever let our kids use?\n682\n00:37:58,060 --&gt; 00:37:59,740\nSo that's the way I think about it.\n683\n00:37:59,740 --&gt; 00:38:01,580\nYou have to be careful using the word addiction.\n684\n00:38:01,580 --&gt; 00:38:03,620\nBut it certainly is a behavior addiction.\n685\n00:38:03,620 --&gt; 00:38:05,500\nIt's a psychological dependency.\n686\n00:38:05,500 --&gt; 00:38:07,740\nAnd I think it alteres developmental pathways.\n687\n00:38:07,740 --&gt; 00:38:11,780\nAnything you do hours a day every day for years is going to alter developmental pathways.\n688\n00:38:11,780 --&gt; 00:38:18,260\nSo, John, beyond the sort of four buckets of harm that we just went through, social deprivation, sleep deprivation, inability to pay attention and addiction, the overall mental health of American teens has absolutely plunged.\n691\n00:38:27,580 --&gt; 00:38:34,220\nRates of depression, anxiety, self harm and suicide have more than doubled over the last decade.\n692\n00:38:34,220 --&gt; 00:38:38,780\nNow the skeptic could look at all of those and say, well, I know the answer to that, religion has plummeted.\n694\n00:38:39,780 --&gt; 00:38:41,620\nPolarization is plummeted.\n695\n00:38:41,620 --&gt; 00:38:48,180\nKids are lonely and atomized and we're living in a culture that has a sense of sort of meaninglessness.\n696\n00:38:48,180 --&gt; 00:38:51,180\nAnd that's the real reason why it's not the phone.\n697\n00:38:51,180 --&gt; 00:38:52,180\nWhat do you say?\n698\n00:38:52,180 --&gt; 00:38:56,700\nSo, there's some truth to that and then there's some reverse causality there.\n699\n00:38:56,700 --&gt; 00:39:01,140\nWhy is it that this catastrophe, this mental illness epidemic, it all the English-speaking countries in the same way at the same time?\n701\n00:39:03,260 --&gt; 00:39:05,540\nWe find strong evidence in Scandinavia.\n702\n00:39:05,540 --&gt; 00:39:10,340\nWe find that in Eastern Europe, actually the numbers are getting a little better, in Southern Europe they get a little worse but not a lot.\n704\n00:39:12,380 --&gt; 00:39:17,540\nWell, this pattern is basically what Emil Dirkheim observed about suicide rates 120 years ago, that the Protestant cultures which have the most freedom are more subject to animie or normlessness.\n707\n00:39:23,980 --&gt; 00:39:29,420\nNow these same Protestant countries were the happiest countries in the world for a long time.\n708\n00:39:29,420 --&gt; 00:39:33,740\nFreedom, individualism, this is the liberal ideal, people should be able to construct lives that they want to live and the anglos in the Scandinavian countries they always top the lists of happiest countries in the world.\n711\n00:39:40,720 --&gt; 00:39:44,420\nAnd their young people were the happiest young people until 2012.\n712\n00:39:44,420 --&gt; 00:39:49,140\nAnd you can see this in the graphs of Canadian data where it used to be until 2012 it was the late teen and early twenties girls women who were the happiest compared to older women.\n714\n00:39:55,700 --&gt; 00:39:59,500\nAnd then right after 2012 it plunges and now they're the least happy.\n715\n00:39:59,500 --&gt; 00:40:05,460\nSo something about religious societies seems to confer some immunity whereas if you're in a secular society you're more vulnerable to the effects of the great rewiring.\n735\n00:41:21,320 --&gt; 00:41:26,760\nA few weeks ago, we had Abigail Shryer on the podcast.\n736\n00:41:26,760 --&gt; 00:41:27,760\nI know you know her.\n737\n00:41:27,760 --&gt; 00:41:28,760\nYeah, I listened to her.\n738\n00:41:28,760 --&gt; 00:41:29,760\nThat was a great discussion.\n739\n00:41:29,760 --&gt; 00:41:30,760\nThank you.\n740\n00:41:30,760 --&gt; 00:41:31,760\nSo I thought so too.\n741\n00:41:31,760 --&gt; 00:41:32,760\nListeners loved it.\n742\n00:41:32,760 --&gt; 00:41:36,440\nAnd here's what she said about smart phones when I pushed her on the extent to which they have been detrimental.\n744\n00:41:37,960 --&gt; 00:41:42,000\nShe said, the phones don't completely explain the rising generations, poor rates of mental health.\n746\n00:41:43,000 --&gt; 00:41:46,480\nFirst of all, the decline in mental health is the story that began in the 1950s.\n747\n00:41:46,480 --&gt; 00:41:52,040\nSecond of all, in 2016, already one in six kids between the ages of two and eight had a diagnosed mental disorder.\n749\n00:41:53,040 --&gt; 00:41:56,920\nThat's a lot of little kids who obviously don't have a smartphone and aren't on social media.\n751\n00:41:57,920 --&gt; 00:42:01,680\nAnd then the last reason she added to think that smartphones don't explain everything is that there are Western culture countries like Japan and Israel that are saturated in smartphones where kids got smartphones even younger than us.\n754\n00:42:09,040 --&gt; 00:42:10,600\nThey're also in social media.\n755\n00:42:10,600 --&gt; 00:42:14,560\nAnd yet their mental health is much better, at least than our American teens.\n756\n00:42:14,560 --&gt; 00:42:15,880\nThere's sort of two things in there.\n757\n00:42:15,880 --&gt; 00:42:17,880\nHow do you respond to both of them?\n758\n00:42:17,880 --&gt; 00:42:19,520\nThere's three things in there.\n759\n00:42:19,520 --&gt; 00:42:21,480\nOh, I'm so glad you asked because I listened to the episode.\n760\n00:42:21,480 --&gt; 00:42:25,580\nI listened to that and I could see, okay, Barry is channeling John Heighten, Gene Twengey here to see what Abigail says.\n762\n00:42:28,360 --&gt; 00:42:29,360\nThat's right.\n763\n00:42:29,360 --&gt; 00:42:33,400\nSo first, on the timing, it's true that mental health has been declining in a slow steady way since the 1950s.\n765\n00:42:35,600 --&gt; 00:42:37,960\nThat is true, but it hasn't been a straight line.\n766\n00:42:37,960 --&gt; 00:42:39,640\nGen X was actually in much worse shape.\n767\n00:42:39,640 --&gt; 00:42:43,200\nAnd I think she's also referred to something like the suicide rate being higher a while ago.\n769\n00:42:44,200 --&gt; 00:42:45,200\nThat's all true for Gen X.\n770\n00:42:45,200 --&gt; 00:42:48,880\nAnd as I said, I think that's in part because they had the highest rates of lead poisoning from the huge amount of lead that was dumped at the atmosphere in the 60s and 70s.\n772\n00:42:52,800 --&gt; 00:42:57,400\nIn any case, if we go from the 90s on, mental health is actually getting better.\n773\n00:42:57,400 --&gt; 00:43:04,000\nSo if it was just the general rise of therapy, of over therapy, then we would see more steady increases in rates of mental illness in the 2000s and into the 2010s, but we don't.\n775\n00:43:10,320 --&gt; 00:43:17,000\nWe see actually slight improvements in the 2010s and then exactly in 2013, we see everything take off.\n777\n00:43:18,000 --&gt; 00:43:19,400\nAnd that doesn't fit with Abigail's story.\n778\n00:43:19,400 --&gt; 00:43:22,360\nNow to be clear, she has a piece of the story that I missed.\n779\n00:43:22,360 --&gt; 00:43:23,360\nAnd I think she's absolutely right.\n780\n00:43:23,360 --&gt; 00:43:28,040\nI found that so compelling that, as a psychologist, we all know, psychotherapy works.\n781\n00:43:28,040 --&gt; 00:43:29,200\nThere's a lot of evidence.\n782\n00:43:29,200 --&gt; 00:43:31,240\nIt's a good thing for adults.\n783\n00:43:31,240 --&gt; 00:43:35,880\nIt never occurred to me that adults, as she says, adults are in therapy because they chose to and they want to work on a problem.\n785\n00:43:37,880 --&gt; 00:43:40,280\nAnd kids are usually there because their parents are sending them.\n786\n00:43:40,280 --&gt; 00:43:44,120\nSo she definitely has a piece of the story and she has a piece that I did not work in. I missed.\n788\n00:43:45,440 --&gt; 00:43:49,000\nBut her argument saying that phones are less important, I think there's three points.\n789\n00:43:49,000 --&gt; 00:43:53,760\nOne is the one I just made that actually no mental health really got worse in 2012.\n790\n00:43:53,760 --&gt; 00:43:55,600\nIt wasn't slow and gradual.\n791\n00:43:55,600 --&gt; 00:44:01,080\nThe second one was your point that a lot of younger kids are beginning to have these diagnoses.\n792\n00:44:01,080 --&gt; 00:44:06,600\nNow she's right that part of that is from the therapy culture, but it's not as though kids had a normal childhood until they reached 11 and got their first smartphone.\n794\n00:44:12,000 --&gt; 00:44:15,920\nThe deprivation of play began in the 90s and 2000s.\n795\n00:44:15,920 --&gt; 00:44:21,080\nAnd the great increase in devices began as soon as the iPad came out.\n796\n00:44:21,080 --&gt; 00:44:25,760\nSo a lot of my family videos and when my son was two or three years old, they end with him reaching for the phone saying, &quot;I want iPhone, I want iPhone.&quot;\n798\n00:44:30,760 --&gt; 00:44:33,080\nBecause there was amazing magical devices.\n799\n00:44:33,080 --&gt; 00:44:35,320\nAnd we sometimes gave our kids their phones to play with.\n800\n00:44:35,320 --&gt; 00:44:37,440\nAnd then the iPad comes out.\n801\n00:44:37,440 --&gt; 00:44:40,040\nAnd this is just so suited for kids.\n802\n00:44:40,040 --&gt; 00:44:42,360\nAnd this is the best deal for parents.\n803\n00:44:42,360 --&gt; 00:44:43,960\nYou give your kid an iPad. It's much better than sitting in front of a TV set.\n805\n00:44:45,920 --&gt; 00:44:47,320\nHe'll stay quiet for longer.\n806\n00:44:47,320 --&gt; 00:44:49,160\nOh, and he's making himself smarter.\n807\n00:44:49,160 --&gt; 00:44:51,320\nIt's not like sitting in front of TV, which makes you stupid.\n808\n00:44:51,320 --&gt; 00:44:52,760\nNo, this is active.\n809\n00:44:52,760 --&gt; 00:44:56,760\nSo it's true that five and six-year-olds don't have iPhones, but they have iPads.\n810\n00:44:56,760 --&gt; 00:44:58,960\nOr they have access to them a lot.\n811\n00:44:58,960 --&gt; 00:45:02,560\nSo I think childhood has been rewired, not just for adolescents, but even for children at elementary school and earlier.\n813\n00:45:04,440 --&gt; 00:45:06,200\nThat's the third point, briefly, is the International.\n814\n00:45:06,200 --&gt; 00:45:08,320\nNo, she's right, that East Asia seems to be different.\n815\n00:45:08,320 --&gt; 00:45:14,520\nEast Asia is intensely digitized, but East Asia is also a much more collectivist.\n816\n00:45:14,520 --&gt; 00:45:18,320\nEast Asia, there's much more of an interdependent sense of self.\n817\n00:45:18,320 --&gt; 00:45:20,680\nAnd so this offers a lot of protection.\n818\n00:45:20,680 --&gt; 00:45:24,320\nIt's the freest kids in the freest societies. They're the ones who got washed away between 2010 and 2015.\n820\n00:45:27,920 --&gt; 00:45:33,680\nThere's an anecdote in your book that was sort of so powerful in which, just speaking of the iPad, you're with, I think, your daughter who's five or six years old at the time.\n822\n00:45:37,960 --&gt; 00:45:39,880\nAnd what does she say to you?\n823\n00:45:39,880 --&gt; 00:45:41,440\nShe says, she calls out from the next room. I'm at breakfast at a country in. And she says, &quot;Daddy, can you take the iPad away from me? I'm trying to take my eyes off it, but I can't.&quot;\n827\n00:45:50,280 --&gt; 00:45:53,000\nSo kids don't have executive control. They don't have executive function. They're easily hooked.\nThey're easily addicted.\n831\n00:45:56,760 --&gt; 00:46:01,680\nThis is why we don't let minors experiment with addictive drugs and activities.\n832\n00:46:01,680 --&gt; 00:46:06,200\nBut the iPad is very good as a behaviorist train, which is like having BF Skinner right in front of your child saying, &quot;Here, do this. I'll reward you. Do this.\n836\n00:46:10,280 --&gt; 00:46:11,280\nI'll reward you.\n837\n00:46:11,280 --&gt; 00:46:15,280\nAnd after a few tens of thousands of times, your kid's brain is rewired.&quot;\n838\n00:46:15,280 --&gt; 00:46:21,440\nSo for relatively long time, people have been writing about the obvious detrimental impact that the social media apps and platforms have on girls.\n840\n00:46:26,120 --&gt; 00:46:28,720\nAnd you say in the book, the evidence is overwhelming.\n841\n00:46:28,720 --&gt; 00:46:32,920\nGive us a little bit of that evidence and then I want to talk about boys, which is a subtler story.\n843\n00:46:33,920 --&gt; 00:46:38,440\nSo I'm in a debate with other researchers because they look at the correlation between hours on social media and mental health.\n845\n00:46:41,440 --&gt; 00:46:45,800\nAnd there is a correlation very steadily around 0.15 for girls, which I think is big enough to explain a lot and they think is not.\n847\n00:46:48,280 --&gt; 00:46:51,080\nBut that's just one avenue of harm.\n848\n00:46:51,080 --&gt; 00:46:55,680\nAnd in fact, there's like 15 different ways that girls get harmed on social media.\n849\n00:46:55,680 --&gt; 00:47:00,120\nAnd so a few that we read about and that I read about the book, so visual social comparison we already talked about.\n851\n00:47:01,120 --&gt; 00:47:02,120\nThat's the obvious one.\n852\n00:47:02,120 --&gt; 00:47:04,400\nAnother one is perfectionism.\n853\n00:47:04,400 --&gt; 00:47:06,760\nGirls and boys are sometimes subject to perfectionism.\n854\n00:47:06,760 --&gt; 00:47:08,280\nIt's a kind of an anxiety disorder.\n855\n00:47:08,280 --&gt; 00:47:10,000\nIt can be kind of crippling.\n856\n00:47:10,000 --&gt; 00:47:14,720\nBut one kind is called social perfectionism, which is what you're concerned about is entirely what others are thinking of you.\n858\n00:47:16,520 --&gt; 00:47:18,160\nIt's not internally driven.\n859\n00:47:18,160 --&gt; 00:47:24,080\nAnd that is higher in girls and boy does, boy, do sites like Instagram bring that out.\n860\n00:47:24,080 --&gt; 00:47:26,520\nSomething has to be perfect about your life because you're going to be judged for it or you're afraid you'll be judged even if people actually don't care that much.\n862\n00:47:30,040 --&gt; 00:47:33,400\nAnother is relational aggression, which we've actually, we've already talked about that.\n863\n00:47:33,400 --&gt; 00:47:37,320\nBoys aggression is ultimately backed up by the threat of physical force and domination punching fighting.\n865\n00:47:38,520 --&gt; 00:47:41,120\nAnd that's how a boy gets dominance over another boy.\n866\n00:47:41,120 --&gt; 00:47:42,120\nBut girls have always done it.\n867\n00:47:42,120 --&gt; 00:47:44,200\nCertainly, you know, mean girls shows this.\n868\n00:47:44,200 --&gt; 00:47:47,800\nYou damage and other girls reputation or relationships.\n869\n00:47:47,800 --&gt; 00:47:50,120\nAnd that's been part of the cruelty of girls.\n870\n00:47:50,120 --&gt; 00:47:53,760\nAnd social media just makes it a lot easier to do that.\n871\n00:47:53,760 --&gt; 00:47:56,160\nAnd then they're going to be mislead and on weekends as well.\n872\n00:47:56,160 --&gt; 00:48:01,480\nSo girls just are exposed to just much more relational aggression than they were before.\n873\n00:48:01,480 --&gt; 00:48:04,080\nGirls also share emotions more than boys do.\n874\n00:48:04,080 --&gt; 00:48:08,200\nYou know, if a few girls are anxious and then they all get on social media and talk about their anxiety, that is literally going to spread to other girls.\n876\n00:48:12,600 --&gt; 00:48:15,400\nWhereas if a boy is anxious, he's not going to talk about it as much.\n877\n00:48:15,400 --&gt; 00:48:16,560\nAnd boys are kind of socially clueless.\n878\n00:48:16,560 --&gt; 00:48:18,520\nThey're not going to pick up on it as much.\n879\n00:48:18,520 --&gt; 00:48:23,360\nSo boys, in a sense, had some protection against the mental and this contagion that social media spreads among girls.\n881\n00:48:25,760 --&gt; 00:48:27,880\nAnd I could keep going, there's just so many different ways.\n882\n00:48:27,880 --&gt; 00:48:32,840\nI mean, we haven't even touched on getting contacted by strangers, getting sex-storted.\n883\n00:48:32,840 --&gt; 00:48:34,440\nIt's unbelievable.\n884\n00:48:34,440 --&gt; 00:48:39,720\nOnce scammers can get a child boy or girl, once they can get the child to send them a picture of themselves naked or, you know, part of their body, now they've got them.\n886\n00:48:43,960 --&gt; 00:48:47,160\nAnd then they reveal themselves like, oh, no, I'm not, you know, a kid flirting with you.\n887\n00:48:47,160 --&gt; 00:48:49,240\nI'm actually, you know, a 40-year-old man.\n888\n00:48:49,240 --&gt; 00:48:51,680\nAnd now I've got you and you have to do what I say.\n889\n00:48:51,680 --&gt; 00:48:57,360\nAnd there's the story of this one girl, they forced her to carve their names, this group. She had a carve their names in her thigh with a knife while they watched and laughed. She had to behead her pet hamster in front of them on camera. And then they said, now we want you to kill yourself. If you don't do this, we're going to spread these photos far and wide. You're going to be humiliated. At this point, I'm sure the girl was already thinking about suicide because she felt trapped and humiliated. And thank God she told her mother at that point. And then the mother was able to save her.\n899\n00:49:23,760 --&gt; 00:49:30,000\nBut the idea that we would never let our children wander in a bad part of town unsupervised for months, we would never let them go into, you know, a war zone or a brothel.\n901\n00:49:35,080 --&gt; 00:49:38,000\nBut we let strangers do this to them.\n902\n00:49:38,000 --&gt; 00:49:41,040\nIt's unbelievable to me that we have done this to childhood.\n903\n00:49:41,040 --&gt; 00:49:47,520\nWell, you write in the book about a girl named Alexis Spence, whose life sort of unraveled because of social media platforms that is currently suing meta.\n905\n00:49:50,640 --&gt; 00:49:54,520\nTell me a little bit about what happened to her because I think in a way her story, not the fact that she's suing, but her story is sort of emblematic of what happened to girls.\n907\n00:49:59,000 --&gt; 00:50:03,160\nSo she was this, you know, fifth grade girl, grown up on Long Island. And she had webkins, you know, it's like a toy that you can trap online. And she thought that was fun, but some of her friends made fun of her for this childish thing. No, you should get Instagram. So she gets Instagram. And any interesting beauty before you know what you'll be being sent dieting, videos and content about extreme thinness and anorexia and the skeleton bride diet and all sorts of horrible, horrible things. And she develops very severe eating disorders and she's hospitalized multiple times. And in one of the longer hospitalizations, she goes without her phone for a while. And the mother says, it's like I got my daughter back. Once she was not on the phone for a month or two, she became her normal self again. And this is a story I hear from parents and kids about summer camp as well when kids get off of their devices because the thing is they get off and so does everyone else.\n922\n00:50:54,880 --&gt; 00:50:56,760\nThey're around kids who are not on devices.\n923\n00:50:56,760 --&gt; 00:50:58,240\nSo they actually talk to each other.\n924\n00:50:58,240 --&gt; 00:51:00,640\nThey play together and they get healthy again.\n925\n00:51:00,640 --&gt; 00:51:03,240\nSo Alexis, she was suicidal.\n926\n00:51:03,240 --&gt; 00:51:06,240\nShe had severe malnutrition for a long time.\n927\n00:51:06,240 --&gt; 00:51:07,240\nShe's recovered.\n928\n00:51:07,240 --&gt; 00:51:13,040\nShe's now in her early 20s, but that was a harrowing 10 years for her and her family.\n929\n00:51:13,040 --&gt; 00:51:15,360\nAnd it starts in fifth grade.\n930\n00:51:15,360 --&gt; 00:51:20,760\nAnd Congress passed one law, exactly one law to protect children online, cop at the Child Online Privacy Protection Act in 1997, I think it was.\n932\n00:51:24,940 --&gt; 00:51:28,200\nThat act was completely inadequate, but at least it said that there was a minimum age to sign a contract in terms of service and give away your data to a company.\n934\n00:51:31,680 --&gt; 00:51:32,680\nIt's 13.\n935\n00:51:32,680 --&gt; 00:51:37,540\nOh, but the companies are not liable for that unless they have positive evidence that a kid is under 13.\n937\n00:51:38,540 --&gt; 00:51:40,840\nSo as long as they don't know, then they're okay.\n938\n00:51:40,840 --&gt; 00:51:41,920\nThey can't be sued.\n939\n00:51:41,920 --&gt; 00:51:46,400\nAnd so I argue that we need to raise the age of 16 and enforce it, but for God's sakes, can't we at least ask the companies, require the companies to enforce the age of 13?\n941\n00:51:51,160 --&gt; 00:51:53,040\nLike, that's the only thing we have in law.\n942\n00:51:53,040 --&gt; 00:51:55,600\nThere's been nothing since then, and that's not even enforced.\n943\n00:51:55,600 --&gt; 00:52:00,760\nSo let's talk about how much of this you lay at the blame of tech companies.\n944\n00:52:00,760 --&gt; 00:52:02,080\nHere's what you write in the book.\n945\n00:52:02,080 --&gt; 00:52:07,000\nA few of these companies are behaving like the tobacco and vaping industries, which designed their products to be highly addictive and then skirted laws limiting marketing to minors.\n948\n00:52:13,000 --&gt; 00:52:17,400\nYou also make the analogy in the book to oil companies that fought against a ban on lead and gasoline, even though the evidence was clear that lead in the atmosphere affected brain development.\n951\n00:52:24,580 --&gt; 00:52:29,720\nSo I want to know, did they know in Silicon Valley what they were creating? Did they understand they were making a kind of heroin for kids and they did they decide to do it anyway? Or did they sort of stumble as backwards into something that is perhaps more addictive than cigarettes or vaping?\n956\n00:52:43,000 --&gt; 00:52:44,000\nYeah.\n957\n00:52:44,000 --&gt; 00:52:45,000\nSo I think it's some of both.\n958\n00:52:45,000 --&gt; 00:52:48,240\nI think it's nobody had bad intentions.\n959\n00:52:48,240 --&gt; 00:52:53,000\nNobody said, hey, let's try to addict American kids and ruin their lives.\n960\n00:52:53,000 --&gt; 00:52:58,280\nBut once you start a company and you have a product and it is good for some people and it does some social good in some ways.\n962\n00:53:00,400 --&gt; 00:53:02,960\nSo just normal human abilities to rationalize.\n963\n00:53:02,960 --&gt; 00:53:07,160\nIf we really give them the benefit of the doubt, we might say, they might have suspected that their products were harming kids, but they had enough plausible deniability.\n965\n00:53:11,280 --&gt; 00:53:14,320\nThere were some psychologists who said, no, the evidence isn't very good.\n966\n00:53:14,320 --&gt; 00:53:18,240\nSo being very charitable, we might say, well, maybe they didn't know.\n967\n00:53:18,240 --&gt; 00:53:19,720\nMaybe they didn't believe it.\n968\n00:53:19,720 --&gt; 00:53:23,640\nMaybe they weren't trying to harm kids, but maybe that's all it was.\n969\n00:53:23,640 --&gt; 00:53:25,120\nBut then we have the whistleblowers.\n970\n00:53:25,120 --&gt; 00:53:27,400\nWe know that they were warned.\n971\n00:53:27,400 --&gt; 00:53:31,960\nFrancis Hogan brought out documents showing they had seminars on teen psychology and they showed images of the brain and they said the frontal cortex doesn't mature until late teens early 20s and at the earlier ages, kids are especially vulnerable to social concerns and here's how we can get them to spend more time on the platform.\n975\n00:53:44,720 --&gt; 00:53:47,360\nHere's what we can do to keep them engaged.\n976\n00:53:47,360 --&gt; 00:53:50,720\nSo they knew what they were doing and they did it anyway.\n977\n00:53:50,720 --&gt; 00:53:54,680\nIn fact, there's a quote, I think I have in the book from one of the early founders of Facebook. He said about Facebook and all the other platforms. He said, this is exactly what a hacker would do is hack into the psychology of prestige, give you a little hit of dopamine, keep you clicking.\n981\n00:54:05,640 --&gt; 00:54:08,880\nHe said, we knew what we were doing and we did it anyway.\n982\n00:54:08,880 --&gt; 00:54:11,760\nGod only knows what we're doing to our children's brains.\n983\n00:54:11,760 --&gt; 00:54:13,120\nSo no, they knew.\n984\n00:54:13,120 --&gt; 00:54:19,400\nNow, tobacco, they were pushing a product that was undeniably addictive.\n985\n00:54:19,400 --&gt; 00:54:24,200\nBut I think to be said about tobacco is a kid could choose to not smoke.\n986\n00:54:24,200 --&gt; 00:54:25,760\nThere was some pure pressure.\n987\n00:54:25,760 --&gt; 00:54:31,920\nBut I found the numbers in 1997 was the peak year of high school age smoking, 37% of kids smoked in 1997.\n989\n00:54:33,520 --&gt; 00:54:36,000\nAnd that means that two thirds of kids didn't smoke.\n990\n00:54:36,000 --&gt; 00:54:37,680\nSo you could choose to not smoke.\n991\n00:54:37,680 --&gt; 00:54:39,760\nYou can't choose to not be on social media.\n992\n00:54:39,760 --&gt; 00:54:43,320\nNow, I'm sorry, it's not that you can't at all, but it's much harder, especially because it hits you much younger.\n994\n00:54:44,800 --&gt; 00:54:47,360\nYou know, we're talking high school kids for smoking, but we're looking at middle school kids for social media.\n996\n00:54:50,040 --&gt; 00:54:54,360\nSo I think in many ways social media is worse than tobacco, worse than let it gas.\n997\n00:54:54,360 --&gt; 00:54:59,440\nAnd again, 11, 12, 13 year old kids, these kids, they're little, they haven't gone through puberty, they're incredibly vulnerable and easy to exploit.\n999\n00:55:03,120 --&gt; 00:55:05,960\nAnd we're just standing back and letting the companies exploit them.\n1000\n00:55:05,960 --&gt; 00:55:09,200\nFor God's sakes, make them enforce their own age limits.\n1001\n00:55:09,200 --&gt; 00:55:14,040\nFor God's sakes, Congress repeal or modify section 230's that it does just what the original intent was.\n1003\n00:55:15,120 --&gt; 00:55:18,400\nIt doesn't protect the platforms from any lawsuits.\n1004\n00:55:18,400 --&gt; 00:55:20,960\nThe platforms should be liable for underage use.\n1005\n00:55:20,960 --&gt; 00:55:25,280\nThey should be liable for putting an architectural features designed to lure in and addict kids that we need to make them liable and we're not.\n1007\n00:55:29,320 --&gt; 00:55:33,560\nIn March 2021, Mark Zuckerberg appeared in front of Congress. And he insisted that the research that we've seen, and this is a quote, is that using social apps to connect with other people can have positive mental health benefits.\n1010\n00:55:42,360 --&gt; 00:55:44,480\nWhat do you say to that?\n1011\n00:55:44,480 --&gt; 00:55:48,120\nThe natural inclination of an academic is to say, well, let's look for the arguments on both sides.\n1013\n00:55:49,120 --&gt; 00:55:51,120\nThere's some pluses and there's some minuses.\n1014\n00:55:51,120 --&gt; 00:55:55,800\nAnd while that's true, when we look at the pluses of social media, what Zuckerberg was talking about is reports, if you survey kids and you say, how does it make you feel?\n1016\n00:56:00,800 --&gt; 00:56:02,280\nAnd they'll often say positive things.\n1017\n00:56:02,280 --&gt; 00:56:06,640\nIn fact, as he pointed out correctly, even in the Francis Hogan revelations of the study that Facebook commissioned, more kids said that it had positive effects than negative effects.\n1019\n00:56:12,520 --&gt; 00:56:16,600\nOkay, so you have a consumer product that is only harming a third of its users.\n1020\n00:56:16,600 --&gt; 00:56:18,120\nOkay, you know, maybe that's not so bad.\n1021\n00:56:18,120 --&gt; 00:56:20,200\nSo that is incredibly terrible.\n1022\n00:56:20,200 --&gt; 00:56:24,320\nSecondly, to say that there's some mental health benefits, all he really means is they said it makes me feel better.\n1024\n00:56:26,400 --&gt; 00:56:30,960\nWhen you actually look at any other measure of actual mental health problems, you only see harms. Now, some studies find nothing, it's true.\n1027\n00:56:34,400 --&gt; 00:56:38,400\nBut if there was no effect, if it was, if the null hypothesis here was true, then what you'd expect is that some studies show a positive effect, a positive correlation or positive experimental effect, some show a negative, maybe there's some publication bias, so maybe it shifts towards the negative.\n1031\n00:56:50,560 --&gt; 00:56:54,040\nBut you would have a lot of studies where the correlation between heavy social media use and happiness or mental health was positive, but you don't, you don't find them.\n1033\n00:56:58,880 --&gt; 00:57:03,160\nAnd you'd find a lot of experiments where having kids do more social media made them happier, but you don't.\n1035\n00:57:04,360 --&gt; 00:57:08,880\nSo the null hypothesis is definitely false and very confident of that.\n1036\n00:57:08,880 --&gt; 00:57:12,440\nAnd what Zuckerberg was pointing to was a couple of crumbs here and there that allowed him to say, here's a study I can point to where there is some sign that kids say it makes them happier and more connected.\n1039\n00:57:18,600 --&gt; 00:57:20,960\nThat's true, but it's still devastating their mental health.\n1040\n00:57:20,960 --&gt; 00:57:26,120\nIt seems to me that this is a really stratified problem economically.\n1041\n00:57:26,120 --&gt; 00:57:31,160\nThe people who live in Northern California that invented a lot of these apps send their kids to Montessori schools where there are absolutely no screens and they play with wooden blocks all day.\n1044\n00:57:36,400 --&gt; 00:57:43,640\nThe people that don't have the luxury of sending their kids to a private school use these devices it seems to me often as a kind of babysitter.\n1046\n00:57:47,880 --&gt; 00:57:53,240\nAnd if you look at the numbers, the average screen time spent in kids in a single parent home and in low income families and among black and Hispanic families are higher.\n1048\n00:57:57,480 --&gt; 00:58:00,000\nI'd love for you to comment on that.\n1049\n00:58:00,000 --&gt; 00:58:04,440\nThe digital divide used to be that rich kids have computers and poor kids don't, so we'd better get computers to the poor kids.\n1051\n00:58:07,160 --&gt; 00:58:11,080\nAnd oh, you know, our heroes come in, the tech companies will provide a Chromebook, will provide devices for the kids and that will even things out.\n1053\n00:58:15,200 --&gt; 00:58:19,400\nWell, that might have been the digital divide 20 years ago, 30 years ago.\n1054\n00:58:19,400 --&gt; 00:58:24,880\nBut now the digital divide is that kids with two married college educated parents probably are trying to put on restrictions, probably are concerned about the mental health effects and they're struggling and probably failing to really do a lot, but they're trying. Whereas kids who have a single parent, kids who are from less educated or less wealthy families, these kids, they have fewer protections, fewer limitations.\n1059\n00:58:44,880 --&gt; 00:58:48,120\nThe mother has to, you know, is using this as a babysitter.\n1060\n00:58:48,120 --&gt; 00:58:53,280\nAnd so yes, the digital divide now is that it's the wealthy kids and the white and the Asian kids and the kids and married families.\n1062\n00:58:56,520 --&gt; 00:59:01,080\nThey're the ones who have at least slightly healthier environments, whereas all the other groups\n1063\n00:59:01,080 --&gt; 00:59:07,080\nI think have the worst of all worlds.\n1064\n00:59:07,080 --&gt; 00:59:11,840\nAfter the break, the most important part of the conversation, John tells us what action parents can take, stay with us.\n1072\n01:00:52,440 --&gt; 01:01:02,440\nWhat can I possibly do about it?\n1073\n01:01:02,440 --&gt; 01:01:06,680\nTo explain that, I have to first say what the solution is and then we'll talk about how policy makers can support that.\n1075\n01:01:09,000 --&gt; 01:01:14,240\nThe key idea in my book is that we're stuck in a set of collective action problems.\n1076\n01:01:14,240 --&gt; 01:01:17,760\nThe main reason why people are giving their kids a smartphone in fifth grade is because everybody else in their school is doing it and you don't want your kid to be left out.\n1078\n01:01:22,480 --&gt; 01:01:26,120\nOnce we see that, we're each doing this because everyone else is and the kids are spending so much time on these platforms because everyone else is.\n1080\n01:01:29,440 --&gt; 01:01:33,720\nThe key is we have to act together and what I'm doing in the book is I'm saying, if you're with me that there's a mental health crisis, if you're with me that it's caused by the rewiring of childhood, we have to unwire.\n1083\n01:01:39,880 --&gt; 01:01:41,520\nWe have to roll it back.\n1084\n01:01:41,520 --&gt; 01:01:42,840\nWe do that with four norms.\n1085\n01:01:42,840 --&gt; 01:01:46,280\nJust four norms will do most of the work.\n1086\n01:01:46,280 --&gt; 01:01:49,360\nJust list the four norms and I'll say where legislators can help.\n1087\n01:01:49,360 --&gt; 01:01:52,320\nThe first norm, no smartphone before high school.\n1088\n01:01:52,320 --&gt; 01:01:54,760\nJust give them a flip, flip phones did not harm the millennials.\n1089\n01:01:54,760 --&gt; 01:01:56,120\nThey're just for communication.\n1090\n01:01:56,120 --&gt; 01:02:00,440\nThe second norm is no social media till 16.\n1091\n01:02:00,440 --&gt; 01:02:03,840\nParents should say no and it's very hard to say no if your kid is the only one who is not on a platform.\n1093\n01:02:05,480 --&gt; 01:02:09,400\nBut if a third or a half of the other kids aren't on it, then it's easy to say no.\n1094\n01:02:09,400 --&gt; 01:02:14,120\nThe third norm is phone free schools, which is just a no-brainer.\n1095\n01:02:14,120 --&gt; 01:02:17,600\nEverything good happens from letting kids keep the phone in the pocket and this is really happening.\n1097\n01:02:18,600 --&gt; 01:02:21,320\nSchools are really moving this way because the teachers all hate it, the administrators all hate it.\n1099\n01:02:22,320 --&gt; 01:02:24,080\nThe fourth norm is the only one that's actually hard.\n1100\n01:02:24,080 --&gt; 01:02:30,800\nThe fourth one is more independence, free play and responsibility in the real world.\n1101\n01:02:30,800 --&gt; 01:02:35,360\nBecause if we're delaying smartphones and social media until high school, we can't just expect our middle school kids to just sit home doing nothing.\n1103\n01:02:38,360 --&gt; 01:02:41,360\nWe have to let them out to play with each other again and have adventures and have a childhood the way most of their parents did.\n1105\n01:02:44,040 --&gt; 01:02:46,240\nSo those are the four norms.\n1106\n01:02:46,240 --&gt; 01:02:50,200\nAny talent, any community that does the four, I can almost guarantee that the rates of mental illness will come down within two years.\n1108\n01:02:52,560 --&gt; 01:02:54,280\nIt's going to be really, really good for the kids.\n1109\n01:02:54,280 --&gt; 01:02:56,360\nNow how can legislators help?\n1110\n01:02:56,360 --&gt; 01:02:58,520\nNo social media till 16.\n1111\n01:02:58,520 --&gt; 01:03:03,920\nCongress passed a law in 1997 or 8 saying that you have to be 13 in order to sign up for any service that takes your data and it's not enforced.\n1113\n01:03:07,360 --&gt; 01:03:12,000\nAnd the biggest thing Congress could do would be to raise the age to 16 and require the companies to enforce it.\n1115\n01:03:14,200 --&gt; 01:03:18,480\nWe don't let kids into bars and casinos and strip clubs and we don't say, well, it's the parents job to enforce that.\n1117\n01:03:20,000 --&gt; 01:03:22,920\nYou can't expect the bar or the strip club to check ID.\n1118\n01:03:22,920 --&gt; 01:03:24,080\nYou can't expect that.\n1119\n01:03:24,080 --&gt; 01:03:25,080\nThat's the parents do.\n1120\n01:03:25,080 --&gt; 01:03:26,080\nNo, that's impossible.\n1121\n01:03:26,080 --&gt; 01:03:27,080\nIt's not working.\n1122\n01:03:27,080 --&gt; 01:03:30,720\nUnless we keep our kids away from the internet, we can't keep our kids away from social media unless the government helps us by making the companies do something to check age, to do age verification.\n1125\n01:03:36,520 --&gt; 01:03:37,680\nThere's lots of different ways.\n1126\n01:03:37,680 --&gt; 01:03:41,920\nSo if they have to find solutions, they're going to find solutions very, very quickly.\n1127\n01:03:41,920 --&gt; 01:03:47,240\nThere's two arguments that I hear that would be the push back to your claim.\n1128\n01:03:47,240 --&gt; 01:03:50,000\nOne is the parents who say, but John, it's too late.\n1129\n01:03:50,000 --&gt; 01:03:51,760\nThe train is left the station.\n1130\n01:03:51,760 --&gt; 01:03:56,640\nAnd the second are the technologists who are defensive of this technology.\n1131\n01:03:56,640 --&gt; 01:04:01,440\nYou know, Mark Andreessen, the famed venture capitalist recently tweeted that banning phones in the internet for kids would mean that everything they get outside the family is from official authority figures, which would make everything worse.\n1134\n01:04:09,640 --&gt; 01:04:12,080\nSeriously, check out today's authority figures.\n1135\n01:04:12,080 --&gt; 01:04:14,600\nHow do you respond to those two arguments?\n1136\n01:04:14,600 --&gt; 01:04:17,720\nSo the first is that people often confuse, I think, accidentally.\n1137\n01:04:17,720 --&gt; 01:04:20,200\nThey confuse social media with the internet.\n1138\n01:04:20,200 --&gt; 01:04:23,240\nAnd, you know, we generally all agree the internet is amazing.\n1139\n01:04:23,240 --&gt; 01:04:24,760\nWe don't want to ban the internet.\n1140\n01:04:24,760 --&gt; 01:04:27,480\nWe don't want to keep kids off the internet entirely.\n1141\n01:04:27,480 --&gt; 01:04:30,200\nBut the problem for the kids isn't that they have access to the internet.\n1142\n01:04:30,200 --&gt; 01:04:31,520\nThey need it from many things.\n1143\n01:04:31,520 --&gt; 01:04:36,320\nThe problem happens when kids have 24/7 to the internet privately in their bedroom.\n1144\n01:04:36,320 --&gt; 01:04:38,600\nThat's when they get hooked by sex dorshinist.\n1145\n01:04:38,600 --&gt; 01:04:41,960\nThat's when they get into the other really bad stuff I'm told.\n1146\n01:04:41,960 --&gt; 01:04:45,760\nEspecially happens at night, late at night when a girl is in her room alone with her phone for six hours, instead of sleeping.\n1148\n01:04:48,000 --&gt; 01:04:52,440\nSo sure, you can make a strong man argument saying, you know, some people want to ban the internet for everyone under 18.\n1150\n01:04:54,120 --&gt; 01:04:55,120\nLike, no, that's absurd.\n1151\n01:04:55,120 --&gt; 01:04:56,840\nNobody wants to do that.\n1152\n01:04:56,840 --&gt; 01:05:01,440\nWhat I want is an internet that has some guardrails so that kids can just walk into the most disgusting pornographic sites at any age.\n1154\n01:05:05,400 --&gt; 01:05:09,200\nAnd limitations so that the existing law of 13 is enforced.\n1155\n01:05:09,200 --&gt; 01:05:11,680\nWhat I want is really pretty modest.\n1156\n01:05:11,680 --&gt; 01:05:15,400\nAnd you know, the argument that the train is left at the station is just resignation.\n1157\n01:05:15,400 --&gt; 01:05:21,040\nSo imagine I'm a parent in a school, maybe it's a public school, or even a private school.\n1158\n01:05:21,040 --&gt; 01:05:23,040\nAnd the school claims that they're banning phones.\n1159\n01:05:23,040 --&gt; 01:05:27,120\nBut as you said earlier in this conversation, they're not actually banning phones.\n1160\n01:05:27,120 --&gt; 01:05:31,040\nI don't want to be a helicopter parent, but I really, really want to stand by these foreign dorms that you've laid out.\n1162\n01:05:41,040 --&gt; 01:05:43,040\nWhat should I do?\n1163\n01:05:43,040 --&gt; 01:05:44,040\nPractically speaking.\n1164\n01:05:44,040 --&gt; 01:05:48,040\nYou go to anxiousgeneration.com, which is the website for the book.\n1165\n01:05:48,040 --&gt; 01:05:49,040\nYou go to the tab about the book.\n1166\n01:05:49,040 --&gt; 01:05:55,040\nWe have all kinds of resources, including the text of a message you can send to the principal administrator of the school.\n1168\n01:05:56,040 --&gt; 01:05:58,320\nThe key to addressing collective action problems is to act collectively.\n1169\n01:05:58,320 --&gt; 01:05:59,320\nAnd I can tell you almost all the principles that head school, they all hate the phones.\n1170\n01:05:59,320 --&gt; 01:06:00,320\nIt makes their lives miserable.\n1171\n01:06:00,320 --&gt; 01:06:02,520\nThey can't get on these platforms with the kids.\n1172\n01:06:02,520 --&gt; 01:06:04,920\nSo they all hate it.\n1173\n01:06:04,920 --&gt; 01:06:05,920\nWhy don't they ban it?\n1174\n01:06:05,920 --&gt; 01:06:07,560\nI always ask, why don't you go phone free?\n1175\n01:06:07,560 --&gt; 01:06:10,720\nAnd whenever I speak to a principal about this, they give the same answer.\n1176\n01:06:10,720 --&gt; 01:06:14,320\nBecause some of the parents will freak out, they'll get so upset, and so we just can't do it.\n1178\n01:06:15,320 --&gt; 01:06:18,840\nWell, yes, there are some parents who will freak out because they think it's their God-given right to communicate with their child while he's in math class.\n1180\n01:06:22,040 --&gt; 01:06:23,720\nAnd it's not their God-given right.\n1181\n01:06:23,720 --&gt; 01:06:27,800\nThe school needs to educate the kids, and it can't do it if the kids are attending to their phones instead of the teachers.\n1183\n01:06:29,720 --&gt; 01:06:34,320\nSo, but what the leaders need, and this is just basic politics, what they need is to hear from the majority that want something done.\n1185\n01:06:37,480 --&gt; 01:06:40,960\nAnd most parents, I believe, do, or they certainly will once they understand what this is doing to their kids.\n1187\n01:06:42,280 --&gt; 01:06:47,520\nSo a simple step you can take is just start a text thread with at least one of the parents of each of your kids' best friends.\n1189\n01:06:48,840 --&gt; 01:06:52,280\nIf your kid has a group of three or four kids that hang out together, start a text thread saying, hey, I heard this podcast with Barry Weiss and John Hyde, and they said that if we all should delay, not till eighth grade, eighth grade is too early, we should all delay until high school.\n1193\n01:07:03,640 --&gt; 01:07:04,640\nI'd like to do that.\n1194\n01:07:04,640 --&gt; 01:07:05,640\nWhat do you guys think?\n1195\n01:07:05,640 --&gt; 01:07:10,000\nAnd so just start a text thread and probably the other parents are also concerned.\n1196\n01:07:10,000 --&gt; 01:07:14,240\nAnd if you start that mostly, whatever I go, people are incredibly supportive.\n1197\n01:07:14,240 --&gt; 01:07:17,880\nI'm facing no opposition, no one's arguing against me.\n1198\n01:07:17,880 --&gt; 01:07:19,560\nIt's the most extraordinary thing.\n1199\n01:07:19,560 --&gt; 01:07:23,040\nSo we really just need to coordinate and we can solve this problem.\n1200\n01:07:23,040 --&gt; 01:07:29,400\nBut when push comes to shove, I suspect that certain parents in theory will pay lip service to everything you've been talking about, but will hesitate to actually do it because they're scared of pissing their kid off.\n1203\n01:07:36,480 --&gt; 01:07:41,320\nThey're scared of being the lame, strict, disciplinarian, authoritative parent.\n1204\n01:07:41,320 --&gt; 01:07:43,360\nYes, that is true.\n1205\n01:07:43,360 --&gt; 01:07:46,760\nAnd that is true if you are the only parent doing it.\n1206\n01:07:46,760 --&gt; 01:07:51,080\nThere was a review of the anxious generation in the Times in the UK, a very positive review by Helen Rumbolo.\n1208\n01:07:52,760 --&gt; 01:07:54,120\nAnd so here's how she ended it. She said, when I caught one of my teenagers between squirrels and asked her, would you have liked a social media ban until you were 16? She asked, would the ban affect everyone? And she paused to think. Then she said, yes, I'd have liked that, she said. And then the journalist says it was an IRL moment that made me sadder than almost anything I'd read.\n1216\n01:08:17,720 --&gt; 01:08:20,920\nBecause the young people themselves don't want to be trapped, but they're trapped. They feel trapped.\n1218\n01:08:22,480 --&gt; 01:08:28,560\nAnd so a ban, or rather, I should just say, raising the age to 16 and enforcing it would free them.\n1220\n01:08:29,560 --&gt; 01:08:32,720\nAnd that's why we're calling the movement free the anxious generation.\n1221\n01:08:32,720 --&gt; 01:08:37,800\nYou write that kids in America today and in the Westward generally are coming of age in a confusing, place-less, a-historical maelstrom of 30-second stories curated by algorithms designed to mesmerize them without solid knowledge of the past and the filtering of good ideas from bad.\n1225\n01:08:52,520 --&gt; 01:08:58,000\nA process that plays out over many generations, young people will be more prone to believe whatever terrible ideas become popular around them, which might explain why videos showing young people reacting positively to a psalm of bin Laden's thoughts about America were trending on TikTok last fall.\n1229\n01:09:12,240 --&gt; 01:09:19,120\nTalk to us about is the last thought, what's at stake here if we don't change course? What's at stake is the loss of a generation or two or three to many things, the loss of their connection to everything that came before.\n1232\n01:09:29,920 --&gt; 01:09:32,800\nSo my first book was The Happiness Hypothesis. It was about ancient wisdom and all that ancient civilizations and societies learned about how to live a good life and have a good society. And we learned all kinds of lessons in the 20th century about communism, fascism, about economics. We've learned an awful lot as a species and as a culture. And if kids grow up on social media, they don't have any room in their input streams for any of that. They don't know it really anything that happened before 2010. And so they're growing up without roots, without any historical and any inheritance from the past. So we're talking about the loss of Western world civilization and culture. That's bad enough. We're also talking about a generation that has no time to actually do anything that goes outside the bubble.\n1246\n01:10:18,120 --&gt; 01:10:22,680\nSo if you have to spend, the Gallaudet is nine hours a day on your phone, your other screens, there's not time for anything else.\n1248\n01:10:24,360 --&gt; 01:10:26,960\nAnd if you're walking down the street, you're listening to something.\n1249\n01:10:26,960 --&gt; 01:10:27,960\nThere's no time to think. There's no time to daydream. There's no time to be bored. And so if you have no attention to give, no time to do anything, you're not going to do anything.\n1254\n01:10:36,160 --&gt; 01:10:40,520\nMy prediction is that is that Gen Z, they're certainly smart.\n1255\n01:10:40,520 --&gt; 01:10:42,920\nThey certainly want to be successful.\n1256\n01:10:42,920 --&gt; 01:10:46,160\nBut they're very risk averse and they have very little attention to give.\n1257\n01:10:46,160 --&gt; 01:10:50,280\nSo I think we're going to see fewer companies started, fewer risks taken.\n1258\n01:10:50,280 --&gt; 01:10:51,800\nThey'll go for safer jobs.\n1259\n01:10:51,800 --&gt; 01:10:53,440\nThere'll be less innovation.\n1260\n01:10:53,440 --&gt; 01:10:55,040\nNow maybe AI will make up for that.\n1261\n01:10:55,040 --&gt; 01:10:59,280\nMaybe AI will be so creative that we can afford to have all human beings from now on just sit back and consume and not think anything, not do anything productive.\n1263\n01:11:03,200 --&gt; 01:11:05,480\nI sure as hell don't want to live in that world.\n1264\n01:11:05,480 --&gt; 01:11:08,840\nBut that I think is, I hate to be so apocalyptic at the end.\n1265\n01:11:08,840 --&gt; 01:11:10,720\nI'd rather end hopefully.\n1266\n01:11:10,720 --&gt; 01:11:16,080\nBut if we don't act, if we just let it go as it is, I don't see how this turns around by itself.\n1268\n01:11:17,200 --&gt; 01:11:22,440\nWe would have a generation that is not really able to take on the massive challenges that we left them.\n1270\n01:11:23,520 --&gt; 01:11:27,120\nThey bear no responsibility for the mess the world is in.\n1271\n01:11:27,120 --&gt; 01:11:30,720\nBut we are making them poorly equipped to handle it.\n1272\n01:11:30,720 --&gt; 01:11:33,960\nSo that would be the negative apocalyptic side.\n1273\n01:11:33,960 --&gt; 01:11:39,080\nThe hopeful ending that I hope we can end on is that in our divided society, where it seems\n1274\n01:11:39,080 --&gt; 01:11:43,800\nlike we can't really fix anything, this is the one issue that we can fix.\n1275\n01:11:43,800 --&gt; 01:11:48,040\nThis is an issue where how much money would cost to fix this to do my fore-norms?\n1276\n01:11:48,040 --&gt; 01:11:49,040\nZero.\n1277\n01:11:49,040 --&gt; 01:11:50,040\nZero.\n1278\n01:11:50,040 --&gt; 01:11:52,040\nYeah, you'd have to buy some phone lockers, but that's about it.\n1279\n01:11:52,040 --&gt; 01:11:53,360\nIt's cost nothing to fix.\n1280\n01:11:53,360 --&gt; 01:11:55,040\nYou know what the political division is on this?\n1281\n01:11:55,040 --&gt; 01:11:56,040\nTell me.\n1282\n01:11:56,040 --&gt; 01:11:57,040\nZero.\n1283\n01:11:57,040 --&gt; 01:11:58,240\nEveryone has kids.\n1284\n01:11:58,240 --&gt; 01:12:00,280\nSo there's very little political divide.\n1285\n01:12:00,280 --&gt; 01:12:03,320\nIt's one of the most bipartisan issues in Congress.\n1286\n01:12:03,320 --&gt; 01:12:04,760\nSo it costs nothing.\n1287\n01:12:04,760 --&gt; 01:12:06,400\nThere's no political divide.\n1288\n01:12:06,400 --&gt; 01:12:09,400\nThere's really no organized opposition other than of course that meta is some sure of our all kinds of lobbyists, but other than that, there's really not political opposition.\n1290\n01:12:15,360 --&gt; 01:12:19,960\nAnd the kids themselves, not that all would vote for it right away, but they're really dissatisfied with what they have.\n1292\n01:12:22,440 --&gt; 01:12:26,640\nAnd whenever I speak to Gen Z audiences and I lay it out, they want it.\n1293\n01:12:26,640 --&gt; 01:12:29,240\nThey say yes, we would like to break out of this.\n1294\n01:12:29,240 --&gt; 01:12:31,800\nSo I actually think that we're going to be successful.\n1295\n01:12:31,800 --&gt; 01:12:39,320\nI think that by the end of 2025, norms about 10-year-olds spending their day scrolling on a screen like that's going to be seen as an incredibly destructive, sad thing to do.\n1297\n01:12:44,760 --&gt; 01:12:45,760\nAnd some will still do it.\n1298\n01:12:45,760 --&gt; 01:12:49,160\nI'm not saying we'll get to zero, but I think right now the norm is you kind of have to do that if you want to keep up.\n1300\n01:12:50,800 --&gt; 01:12:51,800\nWe're going to free them.\n1301\n01:12:51,800 --&gt; 01:12:56,840\nWe're going to free the anxious generation from the need to constantly, constantly be online checking up on everyone else.\n1303\n01:12:59,280 --&gt; 01:13:02,200\nWell, John Hyne, as always, it's a total pleasure.\n1304\n01:13:02,200 --&gt; 01:13:04,840\nHis new book is the anxious generation.\n1305\n01:13:04,840 --&gt; 01:13:10,160\nHow the great rewiring of childhood is causing an epidemic of mental illness.\n1306\n01:13:10,160 --&gt; 01:13:12,000\nThank you so much.\n1307\n01:13:12,000 --&gt; 01:13:13,000\nThank you, Barry.\n1308\n01:13:13,000 --&gt; 01:13:17,560\nThank you for all you're doing at Free Press.\n1309\n01:13:17,560 --&gt; 01:13:18,680\nThanks for listening.\n1310\n01:13:18,680 --&gt; 01:13:22,480\nIf you liked this episode, please share it with your friends and family, especially the\n1311\n01:13:22,480 --&gt; 01:13:26,240\nparents you know, and use it to have a conversation of your own.\n1312\n01:13:26,240 --&gt;

		"content": "The Outrageous Rise of Neotoddlerism\nAcross the West, protests are getting larger, more frequent, and more disruptive. Over the weekend, the UK saw nationwide anti-immigration riots in which cars were flipped over and buildings set aflame. A few days before that, Just Stop Oil activists sprayed orange paint in the world’s second-busiest airport, Heathrow. The week before, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the US Congress, pro-Palestine activists rioted in Columbus Square, vandalizing memorials and releasing a swarm of maggots and worms in his Washington hotel.\nThese are just the latest examples of a growing trend of shock-activism that combines political protest and public nuisance, and which has this year seen activists across the West spray-paint Stonehenge, squat on university campuses, block access to roads and bridges, occupy museums and government buildings, storm sports events and movie premieres, attack priceless artworks and historical artifacts, and even desecrate war memorials and holocaust monuments.\nOstensibly, these “nuisance-protests” are carried out by distinct groups motivated by a particular cause, such as the environment, Palestine, trans-rights, or immigration. In reality, however, all are animated by the same, self-destructive ideology: neotoddlerism.\nThis movement has its roots in the digital revolution of 2009, when use of smartphones and social media reached a critical mass, allowing strangers to easily unite and mobilize around shared views, which led to a rapid increase in the size and frequency of protests around the world. But protests didn’t just become bigger and more frequent, they also became more outrageous.\nIn infants, the chief causes of outrageous behavior — impulsivity, attention-seeking, and a sense of entitlement — are considered normal, but in adults they’re key symptoms of the “cluster-B” personality disorders. All four such disorders —  narcissistic, histrionic, antisocial and borderline — are associated with heavy social media use, most likely because impulsive and dramatic cluster-B behaviors, such as playing the victim and catastrophizing, excel at getting attention on such platforms.\nThe ease with which dramatic and impulsive behavior get attention online has convinced many political activists that a better world doesn’t require years of patient work, only a sufficient quantity of drama and impulsivity. Many activists on both the Left and Right now hope to bring about their ideal world in the same way a spoiled brat acquires a toy they’ve been denied: by being as loud and hysterical as possible. This is neotoddlerism: the view that utopia can be achieved by acting like a three-year old.\nIt’s an ideology for an age of instant gratification, activism for the attention-deficit generation. Just as convenience culture has led us from hours-long films, to half-hour-long TV shows, to minutes-long YouTube videos, to seconds-long TikTok clips; so the same dumbing-down is happening to politics: the arduous process of discussion and debate is giving way to the instant hit of shocking outbursts and other viral moments.\nInstead of trying to produce the best arguments, neotoddlers try to produce the most outrageous video clips, which typically involves vandalism, desecration, or some other kind of public meltdown. Thus, they outrage others by embracing their own outrage and lashing out at the world. This surrender to their own impulses makes them first-order thinkers, meaning they consider immediate consequences but not consequences of consequences.\nThis chronological myopia was starkly illustrated after the October 7 terrorist attack by Hamas against Israel. Many neotoddlers celebrated the massacre because, in their fairy-tale worldview, Palestine is the damsel, Hamas is the knight, and Israel is the dragon. However, the cheering neotoddlers, trapped by their emotions in a perpetual present, couldn’t think far enough ahead to realize that Israel was going to retaliate, and that its wrath would be catastrophic for the Palestinians. When the inevitable retaliation came, the neotoddlers’ joy turned to horror as it dawned on them that actions have consequences.\n[\n\n](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F512285b3-93db-4c1d-8bfc-34b910e1b5a5_950x1035.jpeg)\nNeotoddlers, enslaved by their impulses, focus on immediate gratification at the expense of their own long-term interests\nOne young pro-Palestine activist, Riddhi Patel, learned this lesson the hard way. In April, she addressed councilors at a Bakersfield City Council meeting in California, and, outraged by their refusal to pass a motion calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, proclaimed to the councilors that she’d murder them, adding: “I hope one day somebody brings the guillotine and kills all of you motherfuckers.” Later, she appeared in court on 16 felony counts, sobbing uncontrollably as she was confronted by the second-order effects that her first-order thinking had failed to foresee.\nUnfortunately, it’s unlikely she’ll learn much from her punishment. Not only do neotoddlers lack impulse-control, they also mistake their lack of impulse-control for morality, and mistake the impulse-control of others for callousness. “Where is the outrage?” they commonly yell, demanding everyone be as irrational as them. For the neotoddler, impatience is a virtue.\nThe Civil Rights movement succeeded because it was guided by leaders who had clear, specific, and realistic goals, and were able to negotiate to achieve them. Since neotoddlers “organize” mostly on social media, they’re decentralized, and don’t have leaders that can guide them or negotiate for them. They are therefore ruled by their loftiest ideals, in service to their basest impulses, and they don’t have the means to create, only to disrupt.\nAnd so they disrupt, with the goal of spreading awareness. Yet their attempts to do so are misguided because, for all the issues they protest about, the problem is not a lack of awareness; it’s a lack of solutions. We don’t need to be told that war, crime, and pollution are bad, because we learned such lessons in primary school. What we need are clear, specific, and realistic plans of action. And the neotoddlers, being impulsive short-term thinkers, have only broad demands but no rational way to achieve them.\nAnti-immigrant activists chant “Get them out!” as if there weren’t a host of legal and logistical challenges to doing so. Pro-Palestine activists chant “ceasefire now!” as if such a ceasefire wouldn’t quickly be broken by Hamas like they did on October 7th. Climate activists chant “Just stop oil!” as if that wouldn’t cause Western civilization to regress technologically backwards into an age of famine, war, and superstition.\nNeotoddlers are so shambolic they even try to disrupt attempts to meet their own demands. Many pro-Palestine activists call for peace in Gaza and yet support Hamas, the main obstacle to peace in Gaza. And many eco-warriors oppose fossil fuels but also try to stop viable alternatives such as electric and nuclear by, for example, storming Tesla factories and atomic energy conferences. And recent Right-wing protesters in Sunderland, who claimed to represent the unheard, burned down a citizens’ advice center, one of the few places to offer an ear to the unheard.\nUnsurprisingly, nuisance-protests often end up alienating ordinary people. While the public supports climate action, it has a negative opinion of Just Stop Oil. And while the public supports a ceasefire in Gaza, it has a negative opinion of the campus protesters. The same is true of Right-wing nuisance protests: while the public generally believes immigration should be curbed, it overwhelmingly opposes the recent riots, which have achieved little except convince the public that Right-wing extremism is a serious threat. So, though nuisance-protests do get attention, little of that attention is converted to sympathy and a lot to spite.\nBut if nuisance-protests are counterproductive, why are they spreading? Because protests are usually motivated more by emotion than reason. Take the recent Southport riots. These have been driven not by any rational plan but by the frustrations of Right-wingers and ordinary working-class people that their communities have been forgotten and their concerns about immigration are not being taken seriously by politicians. These frustrations, stoked by fake news, have led them to engage in infantile actions like vandalizing mosques and setting fire to police cars, all of which hurt their cause more than help it. It does, however, make them feel good for the moment, and they live mostly for the moment.\nAs for Left-wing neotoddlers, their motivations tend to be more complex (but no less childish), because they’re generally much more affluent than Right-wing neotoddlers. For instance, an analysis by the Washington Monthly revealed that the Gaza campus protests were largely confined to the most expensive and elite colleges. And Just Stop Oil members are themselves quick to admit that their movement is “privileged” and living in a white middle-class “student bubble”.\nThis is no accident: it’s often the prosperous, not the downtrodden, who have a greater motivation to protest. As the philosopher Eric Hoffer explained in his 1951 book, The True Believer:\n\nThere is perhaps no more reliable indicator of a society’s ripeness for a mass movement than the prevalence of unrelieved boredom. In almost all the descriptions of the periods preceding the rise of mass movements there is reference to vast ennui; and in their earliest stages mass movements are more likely to find sympathizers and support among the bored than among the exploited and oppressed.\n\nPeople need struggles. If their supply of problems dwindles too low, they begin to embellish the problems they already have, or invent completely new ones. As Hoffer writes:\n\nPassionate hatred can give meaning and purpose to an empty life. Thus people haunted by the purposelessness of their lives try to find a new content not only by dedicating themselves to a holy cause but also by nursing a fanatical grievance.\n\nThe young and privileged are particularly prone to this. They don’t have to worry about money, nor do they have homes or families of their own, so they have nothing to lose, and nothing to conserve. This gives them both the need to find struggles and the luxury to be radical.\nOverall, Left-wing neotoddlers and Right-wing neotoddlers tend to come from different demographics — with the former being younger, richer, more educated, and more female than the latter — and this gives them different motivations, and different modus operandi. For instance, research suggests that the cluster-B trait of narcissism takes a different form in the two groups. In Right-wingers, it mostly manifests as a sense of entitlement, while in Left-wingers it mostly manifests as a need for exhibitionism.\nThis is born out in the different approaches Left-wingers and Right-wingers take towards their public tantrums. The nuisance-protests of right-wingers are primarily attempts to relieve their frustrations at not getting what they want. As such, they typically take the form of straightforward thuggery and hooliganism: starting fires, overturning cars, and hurling bricks.\nIn contrast, Left-wing nuisance-protests tend to be less about relieving frustration and more about getting attention directly. As such, they’re usually more calculated and creative: throwing soup over paintings, releasing insect-swarms into hotels, or, most recently, painting the hands of a statue of Anne Frank red.\nGenerally, the Left-wing approach is more effective at getting attention; it took mass destruction by hundreds of Right-wingers in Southport to make news headlines, but it only took two Just Stop Oil activists with orange paint at Heathrow to achieve the same.\nLeft-wing nuisance-protests are also treated more kindly by the mainstream. Right-wing protests tend to be roundly condemned by polite society, firstly because they tend to be more violent, and secondly because upholders of mainstream culture — such as liberal journalists, academics, and entertainers — are culturally programmed to dismiss concerns about Islam or immigration as “far-Right”, placing such concerns outside the bounds of polite discourse (and into the hands of actual extremists).\nIn contrast, Left-wing neotoddlers are generally viewed by Western cultural elites as well-meaning. When Left-wingers recently flooded the streets of Walthamstow to counter-protest the Right-wingers, they were lauded by many Western outlets — from the BBC to NBC — as spreading peace and unity, even though the Labour councilor Ricky Jones used the protest to demand that his fellow Left-wingers slit the throats of Right-wingers.\nThe West’s mainstream knowledge-producing institutions, from academia to the liberal media, tend to be populated mostly by Left-leaning people who see Left-wing neotoddlers as a force for good because they’re broadly ideologically aligned with them and judge them by their perceived intentions rather than their results. For this reason, the mainstream treats Left-wing neotoddlers as its golden child, always seeing the best in them, while Right-wing neotoddlers are treated like the red-headed stepchild, worthy only of scorn.\nThis is particularly true at universities, where conservative speakers are routinely shouted down, and students are overtly encouraged to campaign for Left-wing causes, while also being taught that speech is violence and it is therefore acceptable to shut down speech they don’t like by making loud noises. The universities’ decades-long encouragement of cluster-B infantilism reached a tipping point this summer with the campus protests. We saw the students put everything they’d been taught — exhibitionism, catastrophization, and hysteria — into practice. The protests quickly came to resemble a LARP. Whenever the protesters occupied a new part of the campus, they hung banners and declared it liberated. All this liberating eventually made them feel hungry, but when they demanded refreshments from university officials, and were denied, they claimed they were being deprived of “basic humanitarian aid” and might die of starvation.\nThis kind of grandiose fantasizing is emblematic of people with narcissistic traits because it makes their struggles seem bigger than they actually are. As such, we commonly see similar kinds of catastrophization among other flavors of neotoddler; every flood or forest fire is an omen of “climate catastrophe”, biological facts about sex are “erasing trans people” and immigration is “white genocide”. Such histrionics, whether propagated in error or with intention, serve to manipulate other hysterical people into becoming neotoddlers.\nAnd the grim irony is that, by believing the world is worse than it actually is, neotoddlers make the world worse. Their disruptions and vandalism exert a huge economic and social cost on society, and they prevent ordinary people from getting to work, attending funerals of loved ones, and meeting vital medical appointments.\nUnsurprisingly, the harm neotoddlers cause to liberal democracies has endeared them to foreign dictators. The Ayatollah developed a soft spot for the Ivy League campus protesters, cheerleading them on X, and even writing them a letter of support. It also recently transpired that Iran has been funding and directing neotoddlers across the US, and that they even masterminded an anti-Israel protest at McGill University in Canada. Meanwhile, the fake news that sparked the Southport riots was amplified by pro-Kremlin Telegram channels and even Russian state TV.\nSo how do we end this age of neotoddlerism? The simplest way would be to cut off its main source of support. And that isn’t the Ayatollah or Putin, or even the universities. The neotoddlers’ main source of support is, in fact, you and I.\nNeotoddlerism endures because it’s much more effective at making news headlines and going viral than traditional forms of protest. As a case in point, on 22 June, celebrity environmentalists like Emma Thompson and Chris Packham led a huge march of over 60,000 people through London, to raise awareness of habitat destruction and wildlife loss. It received little press coverage. Around the same time, a handful of Just Stop Oil protesters squirted orange paint on Stonehenge; it made the front page of every major UK newspaper and received coverage in the global press too.\nLikewise, last week in London, there was a generally peaceful march against mass immigration, involving tens of thousands of people of all ethnicities, and led by figures like Tommy Robinson and Laurence Fox. It was ignored by most of the press. One week later, when Robinson embraced his inner-toddler and stoked violent riots, they made global headlines.\nAt a time when competition for attention is fierce, it makes business sense for the press and social media platforms to boost stories that outrage people into clicking and sharing. Such platforms naturally form a symbiosis with people who seek to outrage their way to fame: demagogues like Robinson; vandals like Just Stop Oil “poster girl” Phoebe Plummer; and more bizarre figures still, like the “performance artist turned political activist” Crackhead Barney, who wears little but a diaper and seeks to save Gaza by being as obscene as possible.\nBy giving these figures platforms, we’ve not only allowed them to proselytize to huge audiences, but we’ve also turned them into idols — living testaments that you can get what you want by acting like a baby. Imagine how horrifically a toddler would behave if his every tantrum made world news?\nAnd we can’t blame the media for this; they’re just showing us what we want to see. It is ordinary people who have made being a public nuisance pay. Neotoddlerism needs nothing more than attention to thrive — it is physical clickbait — and we just keep clicking.\nThe more we share and comment on clips of people throwing soup over paintings, or graffitiing on memorials, or vandalizing mosques, or blocking roads, or spraying orange paint at airports, or pitching tents on university campuses, the more we’ll see such events recur in real life.\nThe solution to neotoddlers, then, is the same as the one to regular spoiled brats: to ignore their outbursts and deny them attention. The media will stop reporting on these meltdowns when we stop engaging with them. They’ll stop amplifying — and thereby incentivizing — the neotoddlers when we do.\nIf we gave less attention to those who outrage us, and more to those who inspire us, it would incentivize young people to invest their idealism in, and derive their purpose from, finding practical solutions instead of merely restating the problem in ever sillier ways. So we should learn to react more slowly to news, to pay attention to what we pay attention to, and to give more of our attention to behaviors we wish to encourage rather than those we disapprove of. It’s not just the neotoddlers who need to be less impulsive, we do too.\nAnd there are many people in this world who deserve our attention. While Greta Thunberg became world famous by yelling and blocking entrances to public buildings, the Dutch inventor Boyan Slat has been quietly removing plastic from the oceans through his startup, The Ocean Cleanup. His project recently hit a milestone of 15,000,000kg of trash removed from oceans and rivers worldwide, but it’s hardly been reported by the press.\nWe don’t yet have any start-ups to clear the oceans of rubber dinghies, but such a thing is possible, if addressing illegal immigration can be made more palatable to polite society. And that will only happen when the people who wish to “stop the boats” refrain from acting like the violent thugs they’re often stereotyped as, and start supporting practical, adult solutions.\nEvery child begins life throwing tantrums. And every good parent learns to ignore them, because they know that acknowledging attention-seeking behaviors validates them, and prevents their kids from outgrowing them. If we wish to stop seeing good causes ruined by bad actors, we must stop rewarding immaturity. If we wish to usher in an age of post-toddlerism, we must stop making neotoddlers famous.",

		"content": "<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">LEAVE DETAILS</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">LEAVE LIST</a>\nThis project was heavily influenced by ChatGPT, and a LOT (a LOT) of back and forth!!!\nPlugins needed\n\nDataview\nButtons\nQuickAdd\nTemplater\n\nOverview\nThis JavaScript code generates a leave calendar that tracks and displays sick, annual, and personal leave over a specified date range. The calendar also takes into account holidays and leave requests.\nThis version of the code assumes the following:\n\nPay Period Start Date is 9/20/2024\nAnnual Leave is accrued at the rate of 4.6 hours every 14 days after Pay Period Start Date\nSick Leave is accrued at the rate of 2.7 hours every 14 days after Pay Period Start Date\nPerson Leave is accrued at the rate of 8 hours every year, beginning on the first of the year, only to be used once\nMax Annual Leave is 200 hours\nMax Sick Leave is 56 hours\nI assume these <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Holidays</a>\n\nFile Structure\nThe system relies on the following folder and file structure:\nLEAVE_CALENDAR/\n├── Leave Calendar.md # Main page containing the leave calendar\n├── Leave Details # Folder containing detailed leave information (if needed)\n├── UPGRADES # For testing and new features (optional)\n├── Leave_Requests/\n│ ├── Holidays.md # A markdown file containing the list of holidays\n│ ├── &lt;date&gt;.md # Markdown files for each leave request, named by date (e.g., 2024-01-01.md)\n└── TEMPLATES/\n└── LEAVE_REQUEST # Template for creating new leave requests\n\nKey Sections\n\nLoading the Holidays\n\nThe code loads a list of holidays from the LEAVE_CALENDAR/Leave_Requests/Holidays.md file. The holidays are identified by dates in the YYYY-MM-DD format.\n\n`const holidayPage = dv.pages('&quot;LEAVE_CALENDAR/Leave_Requests/Holidays.md&quot;');`\n\n- What to modify:\nIf your holiday data is stored in a different file, update the path to the appropriate markdown file.\n2. Accrual Rates and Maximum Balances\n- The accrual rates specify how much leave (sick, annual, and personal) is earned per pay period (14 days).\n- The maximum balances define the cap on how much sick and annual leave can be accumulated.\nconst accrualRates = {\nsick: 2.7, // Sick leave accrues 2.7 hours per pay period\nannual: 4.6, // Annual leave accrues 4.6 hours per pay period\npersonal: 8 // Personal leave: 8 hours per year };`\n\n- What to modify:\n- Change the sick, annual, and personal values to adjust the leave accrual rates.\n- Modify maxSickBalance and maxAnnualBalance to set the maximum leave balances.\n3. Pay Period Configuration\n- The first pay period start date is set to September 20, 2024, and the pay period length is 14 days.\nconst firstPayPeriodStart = new Date(2024, 8, 20); // First pay period: September 20, 2024\nconst payPeriodLength = 14; // 14 days per pay period\n\n- What to modify:\n- Change firstPayPeriodStart to the start date of your first pay period.\n- Adjust payPeriodLength if your pay periods are different.\n\nDate Helper Functions\n\nSeveral helper functions handle date operations like formatting and adding days.\n\nfunction toISODateString(date) {\nreturn date.toISOString().split(&quot;T&quot;)[0];\n}\n\nfunction addDays(date, days) {\nconst result = new Date(date);\nresult.setDate(result.getDate() + days);\nreturn result;\n}\n\nfunction formatDate(date) {\nreturn new Intl.DateTimeFormat(&quot;en-US&quot;, {\nmonth: &quot;2-digit&quot;,\nday: &quot;2-digit&quot;,\nyear: &quot;numeric&quot;\n}).format(date);\n}\n\n- What to modify:\nThese functions handle date formatting and manipulation. If you need different date formats or other operations, modify these functions.\n\nLeave Request Parsing\n\nThe code fetches leave requests from the LEAVE_CALENDAR/Leave_Requests folder and processes them. Each leave request is stored in a markdown file named by the date of the request (e.g., 2024-01-01.md).\n\nconst leaveRequests = dv.pages('&quot;LEAVE_CALENDAR/Leave_Requests&quot;')\n.where(p =&gt; p.date &amp;&amp; new Date(p.date) &gt;= firstPayPeriodStart);\n\n- What to modify:\nEnsure the path (&quot;LEAVE_CALENDAR/Leave_Requests&quot;) matches where your leave requests are stored. Each leave request file should contain a date field, which is used to track the leave.\n6. Render Calendar\n- The renderCalendar function generates the table, calculating balances and leave usage for each day in the specified date range.\nfunction renderCalendar(start, end, events) {\n// Logic to render the leave calendar\n}\n\n- What to modify:\nYou can adjust how the calendar is rendered, including adding more details or changing the layout.\n7. Table Start and End Dates\n- The tableStartDate is the date from which the calendar begins. The tableEndDate is calculated to be 3 months after the tableStartDate.\nconst tableStartDate = new Date(); // This will get the current date and time\nconst tableEndDate = new Date();\ntableEndDate.setMonth(tableEndDate.getMonth() + 3); // Adds 3 months to today's date\n\n- What to modify:\n- Set tableStartDate to the desired start date for the calendar (e.g., new Date(2024, 8, 9)).\n- Adjust the tableEndDate calculation to reflect a different duration. For example, to add 6 months, change setMonth(tableEndDate.getMonth() + 3) to setMonth(tableEndDate.getMonth() + 6).\n\nRendering the Table\n\nThe dv.table function generates the calendar table using the start and end dates.\n\ndv.table(\n[&quot;Date&quot;, &quot;Leave Type&quot;, &quot;Hours Taken&quot;, &quot;Sick Balance&quot;, &quot;Annual Balance&quot;, &quot;Personal Balance&quot;, &quot;Color&quot;],\nrenderCalendar(tableStartDate, tableEndDate, events)\n);\n\n- What to modify:\nIf you want to change the columns displayed in the table, modify the array [&quot;Date&quot;, &quot;Leave Type&quot;, &quot;Hours Taken&quot;, &quot;Sick Balance&quot;, &quot;Annual Balance&quot;, &quot;Personal Balance&quot;, &quot;Color&quot;] to match the desired headers.\n\nHow to Adjust Dates\n\nSet the Start Date for the Calendar:\n\nFind the line:\n\nconst tableStartDate = new Date();\n\n- Modify this line to set a specific start date, for example:\nconst tableStartDate = new Date(2024, 8, 9); // September 9, 2024\n\nSet the End Date for the Calendar:\n\nThe end date is calculated based on the start date:\n\ntableEndDate.setMonth(tableEndDate.getMonth() + 3); // Adds 3 months to today's date\n\n- If you want the calendar to end 6 months after the start date, change it to:\ntableEndDate.setMonth(tableEndDate.getMonth() + 6); // Adds 6 months",

		"content": "People Don’t Care How Much You Know Until They Know How Much You Care – Quote Investigator®\nTheodore Roosevelt? Margaret Tyson? Zig Ziglar? John C. Maxwell? James F. Hind? Beltone Hearing Aid Company?\n\nItems used to care for medical patients fron Unsplash\nQuestion for Quote Investigator: Interpersonal relationships are based on trust. A knowledgeable person can be impressive, but another quality is more important when establishing a connection. Here is a pertinent adage:\n\nPeople don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.\n\nThis statement has been attributed to U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, motivational speaker Zig Ziglar, best-selling author John C. Maxwell, and others. Yet, I have not seen any definitive citations. Would you please help trace this statement?\nReply from Quote Investigator: This clever saying employs a rhetorical device called antimetabole. Key words in the first half of the statement are reordered in the second half.\nQI has found no evidence that Theodore Roosevelt used this expression. The earliest match located by QI appeared in a 1959 commencement speech by Margaret Tyson who was the Dean of the School of Nursing at the University of Virginia. Boldface added to excerpts by QI:1\n\nNurses graduating from a course at King’s Daughter’s Hospital here last night were told that “People won’t care how much you know unless they really know how much you care.”\n\nMargaret Tyson is a candidate for creator of the saying, but QI conjectures that the saying was already in circulation, and the originator remains anonymous.\nBelow are additional selected citations in chronological order.\nIn 1962 a subcommittee of the U.S. Senate held a meeting which discussed the price of hearing aids. One of the exhibits at the meeting was a manual from the Beltone Hearing Aid Company. The manual included the following passage:2\n\nBeltone has an old saying, “People don’t care how much you know—until they know how much you care.” Now is the time to show how much you care.\n\nIn 1969 a newspaper columnist in Marshall, Texas used the saying:3\n\nThink With Us From Bill Sullivan, Jr.\n“PEOPLE DON’T CARE HOW MUCH YOU KNOW UNTIL THEY KNOW HOW MUCH YOU CARE.”\n\nIn 1970 a newspaper in Sedalia, Missouri reported on a speech made by politician Jerry Jones:4\n\nJones delivered his address to an evening dinner meeting of the Republicans For Improvement Club, a newly-formed Sedalia political organization.\n“People don’t care about how much you know until they know how much you care,” Jones said.\n\nIn 1972 the saying appeared within an advertisement for the Beltone Hearing Aid Company:5\n\nNOBODY CARES HOW MUCH YOU KNOW, UNTIL THEY KNOW HOW MUCH YOU CARE.\nGEORGE A. VUXTON, Dealer\nBELTONE HEARING AID CENTER\n406 Walnut Street\nELMIRA, NEW YORK\n\nIn 1973 a group of students at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah sent a letter to the student newspaper. The letter included an instance of the saying with an anonymous attribution:6\n\nThe statement has been appropriately made, “I don’t care how much you know until I know how much you care.”\n\nIn 1978 Zig Ziglar wrote “See You At the Top”, and he used a version of the expression:7\n\nIt truly “pays” to be genuinely interested in others because employees “don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.”\n\nIn 1984 Zig Ziglar wrote “Secrets of Closing the Sale”, and he used the expression again:8\n\nWhen you are on a sales interview, whether you are selling a product or a business opportunity, you must believe deeply, firmly, and sincerely that what you offer is in the best interests of the person you are trying to persuade to take action. If you believe this way you can sincerely pull for your prospect to buy for his benefit. . . . It’s true, as a wise man said: “People don’t really care how much you know—until they know how much you care.”\n\nIn 1985 the book “The Great Communicators” included a chapter by Lee S. Shapiro which contained the following passage:9\n\n“What you must know is that everyone wants to love and be loved, to feel that they’re important, that they matter . . . Give them the wonderful gift of listening, catch them doing something right, ask them a question, let them know that you care. They don’t care how much you know, until they know how much you care.”\n\nIn 1986 “One Minute Messages” by Dan Clark with Michael Gale included the following:10\n\nWhen others are talking, don’t just be reloading your own mouth to talk, let them know you hear what they’re saying. Listen to learn. People don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.\n\nIn 1989 the following appeared as an epigraph at the beginning of the book “Be a People Person” by John C. Maxwell:11\n\nPeople don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.\n\nIn 1995 by John C. Maxwell wrote the following in “Developing the Leaders Around You”:12\n\nIn all my years of leading people, I must have said this more than a thousand times: “People don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.” It’s true.\n\nIn 1997 “Reader’s Digest Quotable Quotes: Wit and Wisdom for All Occasions” contained the following entry:13\n\nPeople want to know how much you care before they care how much you know.\n—JAMES F. HIND in The Wall Street Journal\n\nIn 2009 a newspaper in Manitowoc, Wisconsin printed the remarks of a fitness facility owner who attributed the saying to the 28th U.S. President:14\n\nThe fitness buff points to a president when coming up with his secret to success. “I truly believe in the famous quote by Theodore Roosevelt: ‘Nobody cares how much you know, until they know how much you care.’ Especially in the fitness industry, we are simply a means to an end and true success lies in motivating others to change their lives for the better.”\n\nIn conclusion, this is a modern adage with an anonymous provenance. Margaret Tyson who was the dean of a nursing school used the saying by 1959, and the Beltone Hearing Aid Company used the motto by 1962. Future researchers my uncover earlier evidence. QI has found no substantive evidence for the attribution to Theodore Roosevelt.\nImage Notes: Picture of items used to care for medical patients from Kristine Wook at Unplash.

		"content": "Soft and Chewy Oatmeal Flax Chocolate Chip Cookies - Love to be in the Kitchen\nThese Soft and Chewy Oatmeal Flax Chocolate Chip Cookies are DELICIOUS! They are made with coconut oil instead of butter and have oats and flaxseed!\n\nThis recipe is like a typical chocolate chip cookie but with a few healthier changes. Instead of butter, you use coconut oil. Just melt the coconut oil until it’s liquid and measure as you would another oil like canola. I love using coconut oil. I usually buy coconut oil from Trader Joe’s or Costco. I also love this one from Amazon.\nIn this cookie recipe, you add a full cup of oats and 1/2 a cup of flax seed! I adapted this recipe from Averie Cooks’ recipe for Soft and Chewy Oatmeal Coconut Chocolate Chip Cookies. I have been wanting to make a cookie and pack it full of flax seed since it’s so good for you! You can read more about the benefits of flaxseed and how to use it in this post. When I was making this recipe I wasn’t sure if 1/2 a cup of flaxseed would be too much but it turned out to be perfect! You hardly notice except that you can see it in the cookie. It gives it a darker color than a typical chocolate chip cookie. If you’d like more coconut flavor, you could even add 1/2 a cup of shredded coconut to these cookies. (But may need to add a little more melted coconut oil if it seems too dry.)\nLook at all that chocolatey goodness! Mmm! These cookies were so good! My kids loved them too and they are my toughest critics.\nJust a note about the recipe, the dough needs to be chilled for at least 2 hours in the fridge. I just place all my dough balls on one cookie sheet, cover it with plastic wrap, and put it in the fridge. But if you are short on time you can just place it in the freezer for 15 minutes and that will work. This helps the cookies not to spread and enhances the flavor. Also, I love to add some chocolate chips on top to make it look prettier and give it more chocolatey goodness!\n\nEnjoy!\nIngredients\n\n1 large egg\n1/2 cup melted coconut oil\n1/2 cup light brown sugar, packed\n1/4 cup granulated sugar\n1 tablespoon vanilla extract\n1 teaspoon cinnamon\n¼ teaspoon salt\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n1 cup old-fashioned whole rolled oats (not instant or quick)\n1 cup all-purpose flour\n½ cup finely ground flaxseed\n3/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips\n\nInstructions\n\nIn a large mixing bowl, or bowl of a stand mixer, add the egg, coconut oil, sugars, vanilla, cinnamon and salt. Mix until combined.\nAdd the baking soda, oats, flour, and flaxseed and mix until combined. Mix in the chocolate chips.\nForm the dough into balls and place on a cookie sheet lined with a Silpat or parchment paper. Top with more chocolate chips if desired. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate or at least 2 hours or up to 5 days. This will help the cookies not to spread. (Shortcut: Freeze for about 15 minutes.) Also, the cookies won’t spread much after being chilled so if you want the cookies to be a little flatter press down slightly.\nPreheat oven to 350 F, line 2 baking sheets with a Silpat or parchment paper. Place the cookie dough balls 2 inches apart. Bake about 9 minutes or until edges and top are just beginning to set. Do not bake longer than 10 minutes to ensure the cookies are still soft. They will firm up as they cool. Let cookies cool for 5 minutes before transferring to cooling rack.\nStore cookies in an airtight container for up to 1 week or freeze for up to 4 months. The cookie dough can be stored in an airtight container for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 4 months.\n\nAdapted from Averie Cooks\nKeep up with my latest and greatest by following along with me here:\nFacebook/Pinterest/Twitter/Bloglovin’/G+\nFor more delicious cookie recipes check out some of my favorites!\nSoft &amp; Chewy Snickers Chocolate Chip Cookies\nDark Chocolate M&amp;M Cookies\nReese’s Pieces Soft Peanut Butter Cookies",

		"content": "stuffed peppers 🛫 2024-04-19 ✅ 2024-04-19\n\nStuffed Peppers - Once Upon a Chef\nClassic stuffed peppers filled with ground beef, rice, tomato sauce, and cheese make an easy weeknight supper.\nAlmost every cuisine has a version of stuffed peppers, or hollowed bell peppers filled with meat, tomato sauce, vegetables, rice and cheese. In the US, the dish undeniably retro – in fact, the most popular internet recipe comes from the one and only Betty Crocker. Here, I’ve given the classic recipe a little update by quickly tenderizing the beef before cooking and seasoning it with Southwestern spices, which complement the sweetness of the bell peppers perfectly. That said, the recipe is endlessly versatile; you can change up the meat, spices, grain, or cheese to give the dish a whole new spin. This version goes nicely with cornbread.\nThe peppers need to be par-cooked before filling so that they cook through. Many recipes call for boiling the peppers first, but I prefer to roast them – more flavor and less cleanup! The best way is to slice the peppers in half from the stem end down through the base, remove all the seeds and membranes, and then roast the halves until they’re tender-crisp.\nWhat You’ll Need To Make Stuffed Peppers\n\nWhen selecting bell peppers, look for peppers that are bright, shiny and firm. They should not have wrinkled skin, soft spots, or moldy stems. I prefer red, orange, or yellow peppers; green peppers are unripe and have an unpleasant, somewhat bitter taste. (If left to fully ripen, green peppers will eventually turn another color, and the flavor will become increasingly sweet.) Bell peppers keep for up to a week in the refrigerator crisper drawer.\nStep-by-Step Instructions\nTenderize the beef: In a medium bowl, add the beef, 1 teaspoon of the salt, and the baking soda.\nUse your hands to mix until evenly combined, and let the mixture sit for 20 minutes while you continue with the recipe. As it rests, the baking soda raises the pH of the meat, helping to lock in moisture and making the beef tender.\nSlice the peppers in half from the stem end down through the base.\nRemove all the seeds and membranes.\nPlace the peppers, cut side up, in a 9×13-inch baking dish; drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the oil and sprinkle with the remaining salt. Roast the peppers for about 20 minutes, until slightly browned and tender-crisp. A bit of liquid will accumulate in the bottom of the peppers; that’s okay.\nMeanwhile, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil over medium heat in a large nonstick skillet. Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, until soft and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes.\nAdd the garlic and cook 1 minute more; do not brown.\nTo the skillet, add the ground beef mixture, chili powder, cumin, and oregano and increase the heat to medium high.\nCook, breaking the meat up with a wooden spoon, until the meat is browned and almost cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the tomato sauce and bring to a boil.\nReduce the heat to medium low and cook, uncovered, until the meat is cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the rice and 3/4 cup of the cheese.\nStir until melted and remove the skillet from the heat.\nRemove the peppers from the oven and spoon the meat filling evenly into the peppers. Sprinkle with the remaining 3/4 cup cheese and place back in the oven.\nRoast for 10 to 15 minutes, until the filling is hot and the cheese is melted and bubbling, and serve.\nVideo Tutorial\n\nRecipe\n\nClassic stuffed peppers filled with ground beef, rice, tomato sauce, and cheese make an easy weeknight supper.\nIngredients\n\n1 pound 90% lean ground beef\n1¼ teaspoons salt, divided\nHeaping ¼ teaspoon baking soda\n3 large red, yellow, or orange bell peppers, cut in half from the stem to the bottom and cored\n3 tablespoons extra-virgin oil\n1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped\n3 cloves garlic, minced\n1½ teaspoons chili powder\n½ teaspoon ground cumin\n¼ teaspoon dried oregano\n1 (8-oz) can tomato sauce\n1 cup cooked rice, quinoa, or any grain\n1½ cups shredded Monterey Jack or Cheddar Jack cheese\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat the oven to 425°F and set an oven rack in the middle position.\nTenderize the beef: In a medium bowl, using your hands, mash the beef with 1 teaspoon of the salt and the baking soda. Let sit for 20 minutes while you continue with the recipe.\nLine a 9x13-inch baking dish with aluminum foil for easy clean-up, if you like. Place the peppers, cut side up, in the baking dish; drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the oil and sprinkle with the remaining ¼ teaspoon salt.\nRoast the peppers for about 20 minutes, until slightly browned and tender-crisp. A bit of liquid will accumulate in the bottom of the peppers; that's okay.\nMeanwhile, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil over medium heat in a large nonstick skillet. Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, until soft and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute more; do not brown. Add the ground beef mixture, chili powder, cumin, and oregano and increase the heat to medium high. Cook, breaking the meat up with a wooden spoon, until the meat is browned and almost cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the tomato sauce and bring to a boil; reduce the heat to medium low and cook, uncovered, until the meat is cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the rice and ¾ cup of the cheese, and stir until melted. Remove the skillet from the heat.\nRemove the peppers from the oven and spoon the meat filling evenly into the peppers. Sprinkle with the remaining ¾ cup cheese and place back in the oven. Roast for 10 to 15 minutes, until the filling is hot and the cheese is melted and bubbling, and serve.\nMake-Ahead Instructions: The peppers can be partially cooked and filled with the beef mixture up to 2 days ahead of time and refrigerated, or frozen in an airtight container for up to 3 months. When ready to serve, defrost overnight in the refrigerator if frozen, cover the dish with foil, and bake in a 425°F-oven for about 15 minutes. Remove the dish from the oven and remove and discard the foil. Top the peppers with the cheese and place back in the oven for about 5 minutes, or until the filling is heated through and the cheese is melted.\n\nNutrition Information\n\nPer serving (6 servings)\nServing size: One 1/2 pepper\nCalories: 381\nFat: 24 g\nSaturated fat: 9 g\nCarbohydrates: 17 g\nSugar: 6 g\nFiber: 3 g\nProtein: 24 g\nSodium: 646 mg\nCholesterol: 74 mg",

Otherwise, you can just skip to the next section since Hetzner will email you the root password if you omit it. You can also skip this step if you already have an existing SSH key you want to use.\nIn your terminal, follow these commands:\nHave your domain ready for the next step. You’ll be renting a private server.\nHetzner is a great choice for me compared to other companies that charge quite a lot for the same offerings. Hetzner is cheap and seems like a popular choice among the Coolify crowd.\nWhen picking a server, there are some details you want to pay attention to:\n\nthe location where you think most of your traffic will come from (I chose Germany since it’s a nice in-between Continental US and Asia)\n\nthe image you want to use on the server (Ubuntu is a great choice)\n\nwhether you will need shared or dedicated vCPU (shared is the best price/performance)\n\nthe server resources like how many CPUs, RAM, and storage your sites and apps will consume. To run Coolify, these are the minimum requirements\n\n2 CPUs\n2 GB memory\n30+ GB of storage for the docker images\n\nlastly, your monthly budget\n\nAdd your SSH key\nAfter your selection, you may want to include your SSH key. Skip this if you want Hetzner to email the password to you.\nUnder the section titled “SSH keys”, click on “Add SSH Key” and a modal will pop up.\nBack to the terminal now, we’re going to copy our SSH key and paste it into the modal.\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n\nThe .pub signifies that this is the public key and the output will look something like this:\nHighlight all the output and then paste it into the modal and then click save.\nAfter that, you will want to review your Hetzner configuration before you complete the transaction.\nIf all looks okay, go ahead and create it. It will take less than a minute to spin up your new server.\nIf you mess up, you can always delete the server and start a new one since they charge by the hour.\nInstalling Coolify\nOnce your server is created, you will see an IP address for your remote server. You will connect to it and configure your server to use Coolify.\nIn your terminal, type in these commands:\nssh root@&lt;server_ip_address&gt;\n\nWhere &lt;server_ip_address&gt; is the one provided to you by Hetzner.\nThe next prompt will ask you to add the IP to your known hosts list.\nType in “yes” here.\nThen you will enter the passphrase that you used to create the SSH key or the password that Hetzner sent to you by email.\nThe authenticity of host '162.55.37.168' can't be established.\nED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:L1WGqdh9jEOSIrQ/eNcDOtgyYNDWCbTIlEtMcp8rs10.\nThis key is not known by any other names.\nAre you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes\nWarning: Permanently added '162.55.37.168' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.\nEnter passphrase for key '/Users/billyle/.ssh/id_rsa':\n\nYou should now have remote access to your server and execute commands.\nWelcome to Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.15.0-91-generic x86_64)\n\n* Documentation: https://help.ubuntu.com\n* Management: https://landscape.canonical.com\n* Support: https://ubuntu.com/advantage\n\nSystem information as of Sun Mar 3 03:54:34 AM UTC 2024\n\nSystem load: 0.0 Processes: 100\nUsage of /: 5.1% of 37.23GB Users logged in: 0\nMemory usage: 5% IPv4 address for eth0: 162.55.37.168\nSwap usage: 0% IPv6 address for eth0: 2a01:4f8:c012:7c82::1\n\nExpanded Security Maintenance for Applications is not enabled.\n\n0 updates can be applied immediately.\n\nEnable ESM Apps to receive additional future security updates.\nSee https://ubuntu.com/esm or run: sudo pro status\n\nThe list of available updates is more than a week old.\nTo check for new updates run: sudo apt update\n\nroot@ubuntu-4gb-fsn1-1:~#\n\nIf you go to Coolify.io docs and search for installation, you should see the installation script which looks like this:\ncurl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash\n\nEnter the command and let the installation script do its thing. Once that’s complete, you will see an output with an IP address where you can access the Coolify instance on your server, in my case it was http://162.55.37.168:8000.\n\nCopy the IP address along with the port and enter that in your browser’s URL. You will be directed to the registration screen for Coolify.\nCoolify Onboarding Experience\nWhen you follow the IP address from the Coolify installation, you will be taken to a registration page.\nSign up to log in to the Coolify instance where we will host it on your domain.\nBe sure to use a strong, unique password since this is how you will interface with Coolify on your custom domain.\n\nYou will be prompted with a series of onboarding questions. Just keep clicking next until you see the page, “Server”.\n\nYou will select “localhost” as that’s where this instance of Coolify is installed.\n\nThen you will create your first project. These projects are a way to organize your resources under one umbrella. Here you will be adding your first project so click on “Let’s create a new one”. This will create a project called, “My first project” for you.\n\nAfter that, the next page says something about adding resources. Resources are things that your app or website needs such as databases, servers, etc. Click on the “Let’s do it!” button.\nIf you’re deploying a static site, chances are, you only have one resource to deploy. Select the “Public Repository” resource.\n\nWhen you click that, you will be asked which server you like to use. There should be only one and that’s “localhost” from before.\n\nThen it will ask you to select a Destination. Just choose the only option which should be a Standalone Docker instance called “localhost-coolify”.\n\nAnd lastly, it will ask you for the URL for the public repository. Paste the URL of your public repo into the field.\nIt will get the metadata from the Git repo and should populate all the necessary details.\nThe important part here is the Publish Directory where the build output will be.\nAlso, toggle the “Is it a static site” toggle if it applies to you.\n\nYou should now see a configuration page for the resource you just created.\nThere’s a lot on this screen but we’re going to focus solely on deploying to see if we can get Coolify to build our application.\nOn the top right corner, click “Deploy”\n\nYou will be taken to the Deployment page and your build logs will start appearing.\nHopefully, there won’t be any errors and you will see a “New container started” as the last log entry and your deployment says “Finished”.\n\nTo test to see if Coolify can serve the website, click on the “Open Application” button and select the auto-generated link to view your site.\n\nYou should see your site being served by Coolify.\n\nKeep your Coolify page open for the next part as we still need to tinker with it later.\nProxy domain from Cloudflare to Coolify\nNow all we need to do is some configuration between Cloudflare and Coolify. We need to point our domain in Cloudflare to our Hetzner server and Coolify will serve our applications.\nIt took me a long time to figure this out so there might be some trial and error on your part, but I hope this next set of instructions just works for you.\nEnforce Strict SSL/TSL Mode\nThis next part is important! Navigate to the SSL/TLS page in Cloudflare.\n\nWe want to turn on SSL Full (strict) mode to allow Coolify to serve HTTPS for us.\nBy default, SSL will be on Flexible mode and if you had this on, both Coolify and Cloudflare will be stuck in a redirect loop causing the page to throw a “Too many redirects” error.\n\nAccess Coolify from our domain\nIn your Cloudflare dashboard, go to the DNS Records Management page for your domain. We want to add a subdomain for our Coolify instance.\n\nAdd a new “A” record, with the hostname “coolify**”, and the value is the IP address of your remote server, and click save.\n\nGo back to Coolify, and go to the Settings page.\n\nIn the “Instance’s Domain” field, type out https://coolify.&lt;your_domain&gt;.\nNotice that we added HTTPS here. Coolify will automatically generate an SSL cert when it sees this configuration. Be sure to hit save.\n\nLet’s see if we can now access our Coolify instance from our domain instead of the Hetzner server IP address.\nHead over to https://coolify.&lt;your_domain&gt; and check out your new Coolify on your domain!\nIf it doesn’t load yet, wait a few moments until the DNS propagates.\n\nNow login with the credentials you used to register in the initial Coolify setup, and you should now be at the Coolify dashboard.\nLink the Coolify app to your domain\nFrom the Coolify dashboard, navigate back to your project configuration dashboard.\nWe’re going to change the auto-generated domain that Coolify created to use our domain.\nType in your domain and then click save. After you save, make sure to click “Redeploy” or else this won’t work.\n\nBack to Cloudflare, we need to create more DNS records to make sure our domain is pointed to our server.\nSo head on back to the Cloudflare DNS Management and enter a new “A” record, with the hostname ”@”, and the value should be the Hetzner server IP address.\n\nNow give it a couple of minutes and visit your domain. You should see live! How cool is that?\n\nRedirect www to non-www\nWe’re almost done with the long tutorial. I was excited when I got this far and I hope you are too.\nThis last part is the final section and what we’re going to do is redirect our www.&lt;domain&gt; to just &lt;domain&gt;.\nAll of this will happen in Cloudflare so we don’t need to mess around with Coolify.\nIn Cloudflare, back in our DNS management, we’re going to add two records.\nThe first one is an “A” record, with the name of “www”, and the value of 192.0.2.1.\nThis is saying we are creating an ALIAS record that uses the www subdomain, and we are pointing to a dummy IPv4 address.\nThe dummy IPv4 address is insignificant since Cloudflare will redirect all traffic before reaching the IP address.\n\nNow we’ll create the IPv6 version with another “AAAA” with the name same name but this time the IPv6 address is 100::\n\nWhile that’s being propagated, we need to set up the actual redirect rules in Cloudflare.\nHead over to the Rules Redirect page\n\nOnce there, click on ”+ Create rule” where you’ll be taken to a form.\nAdd the name of your Redirect Rule. I named mine “www to apex”.\n\nThen click on “Edit expression” where you’ll type in the rule expression. Replace billyle.dev with your actual domain.\n\n(http.request.full_uri contains &quot;www.billyle.dev&quot;)\n\nThe last input field is where Cloudflare does something when it matches the condition above.\nWe want a “Dynamic”, with a “301” permanent redirect and our expression will be:\n\nconcat(&quot;https://&quot;,&quot;billyle.dev&quot;,http.request.uri.path)\n\nAgain, replace billyle.dev with your actual domain and make sure the “Preserve query string” is checked.\nNow test it out after a few minutes to see if it works. Visit www.&lt;your_domain&gt; and see if it redirects you to the root domain.\nThat’s it! You’re done!\nWow, that was a lot! I’m glad you made it all the way through. I hope you’re proud of what you did here.\nThis is our new journey down self-hosting PaaS. The days of paying for a droplet and managed DB are over for me.\nYou’ve learned how to create a remote server with Hetzner, SSH into it, and install Coolify. Then you managed to link your domain to Coolify and deploy your website!\nIf you have any questions, feel free to email me or contact me through my social media links.\nAnd thank you for reading! Hope you have a great rest of your day wherever you are.\nRSS Subscribe",

By default, this is not supported.\nTypically this is provided with most operating systems these days, however, trimmed back ones such as Raspberry Pi OS Lite might have it removed.\nInstall the required package by running the command below.\nsudo apt install apt-transport-https\n\n3. Finally, store the Syncthing GPG keys in keyrings directory.\nThese keys are designed to ensure that the packages we are installing have been correctly signed and aren’t coming from an unexpected source.\nDownload and save the keys by using the following command on your Raspberry Pi.\ncurl -s https://syncthing.net/release-key.txt | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/syncthing-archive-keyring.gpg &gt;/dev/null\n\n4. With the key added, we can now add the repository itself.\nFor this Raspberry Pi project, we will be utilizing the stable branch of the Syncthing software.\nAdd the repository to our sources list by using the command below.\necho &quot;deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/syncthing-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.syncthing.net/ syncthing stable&quot; | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/syncthing.list\n\n5. Before we will install Syncthing from the repository, we need to update the package list.\nWe need to update the list so that the package manager reads from our newly added source.\nRefresh the package list by running the following command on your device.\nsudo apt update\n\n6. Finally, let us install the Syncthing software to our Raspberry Pi.\nWith the package repository now added, all we need to do to install the software is run the following command.\nsudo apt install syncthing\n\nAllowing Outside Access to your Syncthing Web Interface\nBy default, we won’t be able to access the Syncthing web interface without being physically on the device.\nAs this would make it a frustrating experience for those running a headless Raspberry Pi, we can modify the configuration to allow outside access.\n1. Our first task is to get the current local IP address assigned to our Raspberry Pi.\nPlease note that you should have your Raspberry Pi set up with a static IP address before completing this section.\nYou can retrieve the local IP of your Pi by using the following command.\nhostname -I\n\n2. Before we continue any further, we will need to run Syncthing once to generate config files.\nFor this guide, we will just be running Syncthing under the current user.\nsyncthing\n\nAfter the initial run, kill the application by pressing CTRL + C.\n3. After the first run, Syncthing will create all the configuration files we need.\nThis configuration file will only work as long as we run the Syncthing software with our pi user.\nBegin editing the required config file using the nano text editor by using the command below.\nIMPORTANT TO FIND CONFIG FILE:\nfind configuration file:\nsyncthing -paths\n\nsudo nano ~/.local/state/syncthing/config.xml\n\n4. Within this file, you need to find the following line.\nTo make it easier to find this line, you can use the CTRL + W shortcut to search.\n&lt;address&gt;127.0.0.1:8384&lt;/address&gt;\n\nWe will need to replace the local IP defined on this line (127.0.0.1) with our Pi’s local IP address.\nFor example, using our Pi’s IP, this line would end up turning into the following.\n&lt;address&gt;192.168.0.193:8384&lt;/address&gt;\n\nUsing the local IP address, we are restricting access to the web interface only to users on the same local network.\nAlternatively, if you want to allow access to any address, use the IP “0.0.0.0“.\n5. Once you have changed the IP, save the file by pressing CTRL + X, followed by Y, then ENTER.\nSetting up Syncthing as a Service on the Raspberry Pi\nWith Syncthing’s web interface now accessible outside of the Raspberry Pi, we need to do one last task.\nThat task is to create and enable a service for the software. The service will allow Syncthing to start at boot and let it to be easily stopped and started.\n1. We need to make use of nano again to create the file for our service.\nThe service that we will be putting together is from the official GitHub for Syncthing.\nRun the following command to begin writing the file within the “/lib/systemd/system” directory.\nsudo nano /lib/systemd/system/syncthing.service\n\nthis is probably better location?\nsudo nano /etc/systemd/system/syncthing.service\n\n2. Within this file, enter the following lines.\nWhile entering these lines ensure that you replace “pi” with the name of your user.\n[Unit]\nDescription=Syncthing - Open Source Continuous File Synchronization\nDocumentation=man:syncthing(1)\nAfter=network.target\n\n[Service]\nUser=pi\nExecStart=/usr/bin/syncthing -no-browser -no-restart -logflags=0\nRestart=on-failure\nRestartSec=5\nSuccessExitStatus=3 4\nRestartForceExitStatus=3 4\n\n# Hardening\nProtectSystem=full\nPrivateTmp=true\nSystemCallArchitectures=native\nMemoryDenyWriteExecute=true\nNoNewPrivileges=true\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\nThese lines dictate how the operating system will handle Syncthing on our Raspberry Pi.\n3. With all the lines entered, save the file by pressing CTRL + X, then Y, followed by the ENTER key.\n4. With our service created, we can now enable it to start at boot.\nAll you need to do is run the following command.\nsudo systemctl restart syncthing@$(whoami)\n\nsudo systemctl enable syncthing@$(whoami)\n\nsudo systemctl start syncthing@$(whoami)\n\nsudo systemctl status syncthing@$(whoami)\n\nsudo systemctl enable syncthing\n\n5. Next, start the service so that we can begin accessing the Syncthing web interface.\nTo start the service, we need to use the systemctl command again.\nsudo systemctl start syncthing\n\n6. We should verify that our Syncthing service started on our Raspberry Pi.\nWe can verify this by using the command below.\nsudo systemctl status syncthing\n\nUFW profile\nThis tells you which ports the particular app uses\nsudo ufw app info syncthing\n\nUFW settings\nsudo ufw status\n\nOPEN Ports:\n22000/tcp\n21027/udp\nsudo ufw allow 22000\n\nsudo ufw allow 21027\n\nsudo ufw allow 8384\n\nIf the service has started correctly and is running, you should see the following displayed within the message.\nActive: active (running)\nUsing your Raspberry Pi’s Syncthing Web Interface\nAt this point, you should now have the Syncthing software up and running on your Raspberry Pi.\nWe can finally move on to configuring the software and adding a device to synchronize files with. To make this easier to follow, we will split this into smaller sections.\nThe web interface makes the process of setting up and connecting to devices very straightforward process.\nConnecting to the Syncthing Web Interface\nBefore you can even use the web interface, you will need to first load it up in your favorite web browser.\n1. To access the web interface, you will need to know the Raspberry Pi’s IP address.\nWith the IP in hand, you can go to the following web address in a web browser of your choice.\nhttp://[PIIPADDRESS]:8384\n\nIf syncthing status stuck on activating:\nFix the Issue:\n\nStop the Incorrectly Running Service (if it's running globally)\n\nsudo systemctl stop syncthing\n\nStart Syncthing with Your Username\n\nsudo systemctl restart syncthing@$(whoami)\n\nThen check its status:\nsudo systemctl status syncthing@$(whoami)\n\nEnable It to Start on Boot\n\nsudo systemctl enable syncthing@$(whoami)\n\n---\n\nIt’s essential that whatever you type in that the port number (`8384`) remains at the end as this is where the Syncthing software listens.\n\n**2.** Upon going to the web address, you will be introduced to the Syncthing web interface.\n\nPlease note that you will be required to login before seeing the following screen once you set up a username and password.\n\n![Raspberry Pi Syncthing Initial Website With Danger](https://pimylifeup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Raspberry-Pi-Syncthing-Initial-Website-With-Danger.jpg)\n\n### Securing the Syncthing Interface\n\nBy default, Syncthing comes with no username or password defined. What this means is that any user can access the interface and adjust your settings.\n\nTo stop users from being able to do any unwanted damage, you can define login details.\n\n**1.** If you haven’t set the username and password before, you will see a message warning you of the dangers.\n\nTo get to the settings page quickly, we can click the “`Settings`” button on this warning.\n\n![Raspberry Pi Syncthing Changing Password in Settings Option A](https://pimylifeup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Raspberry-Pi-Syncthing-Changing-Password-in-Settings-Option-A.jpg)\n\nIf this message isn’t displaying for you, you can also find the settings page by clicking the “`Actions`” (**1.**) dropdown box in the top right corner and selecting “`Settings`” (**2.**).\n\n![Changing Password in Settings Option B](https://pimylifeup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Raspberry-Pi-Syncthing-Changing-Password-in-Settings-Option-B.jpg)\n\n**2.** Within the popup settings page, you will need to change to the “`GUI`” tab.\n\nYou can change to this tab by clicking “`GUI`” in the bar at the top of the popup.\n\n![Setting Page Goto GUI](https://pimylifeup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Raspberry-Pi-Syncthing-Setting-Page-Goto-GUI.jpg)\n\n**3.** On this page, you will need to enter both a username (**1.**) and a password (**2.**).\n\nMake sure you set a secure password that is not easily guessable. Try and use a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols.\n\nOnce you have entered both of these, you can save your changes by clicking the “`Save`” button (**3.**).\n\n![Raspberry Pi Syncthing Setting a Username and Password](https://pimylifeup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Raspberry-Pi-Syncthing-Setting-a-Username-and-Password.jpg)\n\n**4.** Upon saving your new password, you will be kicked out of the web interface.\n\nEvery time you want to use Syncthing’s interface, you will need to enter your new login details.\n\n### Retrieving your Devices Syncthing ID\n\nSyncthing works by generating a unique ID for every single device. To synchronize data between devices, each one must have the other device’s ID added.\n\nFinding the ID of your Raspberry Pi Syncthing setup is a straightforward process and can be found within the web interface.\n\n**1.** Back on the web interface’s main page, click the “`Actions`” toggle (**1.**) in the top right corner of the screen.\n\nIn the dropdown box, click the “`Show ID`” option (**2.**) to bring up the dialog box we are after.\n\n![Raspberry Pi Syncthing Actions Find Show ID](https://pimylifeup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Raspberry-Pi-Syncthing-Actions-Find-Show-ID.jpg)\n\n**2.** On this page, you will see the identification string (**1.**) and the matching QR code for the ID (**2.**).\n\nThen identification string should be 50-56 characters long and contain numbers, letters, and hyphens. The hyphens are ignored by the system but are there to make the ID easier to read.\n\nYou will need to add your Raspberry Pi’s ID to the other devices you will be connecting to. Likewise, you will also need to add their ID.\n\nThe ID works as part of Syncthing’s method for connecting multiple devices to the same pool.\n\n![Raspberry Pi Syncthing Device Identification](https://pimylifeup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Raspberry-Pi-Syncthing-Device-Identification.jpg)\n\n### Adding a Device to your Raspberry Pi’s Syncthing Pool\n\nNow that you know how to retrieve your device’s ID let us now show you how to add another device’s ID.\n\nRemember, whatever device you are adding must also add your Raspberry Pi’s ID. Otherwise, the devices will not be able to connect.\n\n**1.** On the Syncthing interface, you need to click the “`Add Remote Device`” button located at the bottom right side.\n\nClicking this button will take us to the dialog that will allow us to add a device to our Syncthing pool.\n\n![Raspberry Pi Syncthing Adding a Remote Device Step](https://pimylifeup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Raspberry-Pi-Syncthing-Adding-a-Remote-Device-Step.jpg)\n\n**2.** In this dialog, you can add the device ID you want to your pool.\n\nIn the top textbox (**1.**), enter the ID for the device you want to connect to. As the ID is relatively long, it will likely be easier to copy and paste the ID over.\n\nOnce done, you can click the “`Save`” button (**2.**) to add the device and begin the connection process.\n\n![Adding a Remote Device Options Page](https://pimylifeup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Raspberry-Pi-Syncthing-Adding-a-Remote-Device-Options.jpg)\n\n**3.** Once both Syncthing servers have each other’s IDs added, you should see that you’re successfully connected.\n\n![Raspberry Pi Syncthing Remote Device Successfully Connected](https://pimylifeup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Raspberry-Pi-Syncthing-Remote-Device-Successfully-Connected.jpg)\n\n### Synchronizing a Folder with your Connected Devices\n\nWith a device now connected to our Raspberry Pi Syncthing, we can try sharing a folder with the device.\n\nFor this section, we are just going to use the default folder. In this case, the folder is located at “`/home/pi/sync`” on our Raspberry Pi.\n\n**1.** To begin editing an existing folder’s share settings, click the “`Edit`” button underneath that folder.\n\nThis button will bring up the settings dialog, for that folder and will allow us to adjust who it is shared with.\n\n![Raspberry Pi Syncthing Edit Existing Folders Settings](https://pimylifeup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Raspberry-Pi-Syncthing-Edit-Existing-Folders-Settings.jpg)\n\n**2.** Within the file settings dialog we will need to change to the sharing tab.\n\nYou can change to this tab by clicking the “`Sharing`” tab.\n\n![Change to Sharing Tab](https://pimylifeup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Raspberry-Pi-Syncthing-Edit-Folder-Change-to-Sharing-Tab.jpg)\n\n**3.** Using this dialog, you can select the devices you want to share the folder with (**1.**).\n\nOnce you have the devices you want to be synchronized with selected, click the “`Save`” button (**2.**).\n\n![Share Folder with Connected Device](https://pimylifeup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Raspberry-Pi-Syncthing-Share-Folder-with-Connected-Device.jpg)\n\nPlease note that after you share a folder with another device, you will have to accept it on that device before the synchronization will begin.\n\n**4.** You should now see that your folder has now begun synchronizing.\n\nOnce it has finished synchronizing, you should see both the folder and the device marked as “Up to date”.\n\n![Raspberry Pi Syncthing Successfully Connected and Synchronizing](https://pimylifeup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Raspberry-Pi-Syncthing-Successfully-Connected-and-Synchronizing.jpg)\n\n# Reference\n\n- [Syncthing](https://apt.syncthing.net/)\n- https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-syncthing/\n- https://www.linuxfordevices.com/tutorials/ubuntu/syncthing-install-and-setup",
