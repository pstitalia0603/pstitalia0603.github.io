# [People Don’t Care How Much You Know Until They Know How Much You Care – Quote Investigator®](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2024/07/04/know-care/)

#### **Theodore Roosevelt? Margaret Tyson? Zig Ziglar? John C. Maxwell? James F. Hind? Beltone Hearing Aid Company?**

**Question for Quote Investigator:** Interpersonal relationships are based on trust. A knowledgeable person can be impressive, but another quality is more important when establishing a connection. Here is a pertinent adage:

> People don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.

This statement has been attributed to U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, motivational speaker Zig Ziglar, best-selling author John C. Maxwell, and others. Yet, I have not seen any definitive citations. Would you please help trace this statement?

**Reply from Quote Investigator:** This clever saying employs a rhetorical device called antimetabole. Key words in the first half of the statement are reordered in the second half.

**QI** has found no evidence that Theodore Roosevelt used this expression. The earliest match located by **QI** appeared in a 1959 commencement speech by Margaret Tyson who was the Dean of the School of Nursing at the University of Virginia. Boldface added to excerpts by **QI:**[1](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2024/07/04/know-care/#340847a3-8229-4712-8f05-b3d7835df66a)

> Nurses graduating from a course at King’s Daughter’s Hospital here last night were told that **“People won’t care how much you know unless they really know how much you care.”**

Margaret Tyson is a candidate for creator of the saying, but **QI** conjectures that the saying was already in circulation, and the originator remains anonymous.

Below are additional selected citations in chronological order.

In 1962 a subcommittee of the U.S. Senate held a meeting which discussed the price of hearing aids. One of the exhibits at the meeting was a manual from the Beltone Hearing Aid Company. The manual included the following passage:[2](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2024/07/04/know-care/#34f580f7-8306-4d29-ad6b-49d2f01bb0a6)

> Beltone has an old saying, **“People don’t care how much you know—until they know how much you care.”** Now is the time to show how much you care.

In 1969 a newspaper columnist in Marshall, Texas used the saying:[3](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2024/07/04/know-care/#ef55a970-9b92-487d-8412-00cfb5102d15)

> Think With Us From Bill Sullivan, Jr.  
> **“PEOPLE DON’T CARE HOW MUCH YOU KNOW UNTIL THEY KNOW HOW MUCH YOU CARE.”**

In 1970 a newspaper in Sedalia, Missouri reported on a speech made by politician Jerry Jones:[4](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2024/07/04/know-care/#dc4d0cba-3753-4885-8954-c86149ead9b4)

> Jones delivered his address to an evening dinner meeting of the Republicans For Improvement Club, a newly-formed Sedalia political organization.
> 
> **“People don’t care about how much you know until they know how much you care,”** Jones said.

In 1972 the saying appeared within an advertisement for the Beltone Hearing Aid Company:[5](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2024/07/04/know-care/#9061cb3e-2d14-43d9-86d4-7d3f3002bedd)

> **NOBODY CARES HOW MUCH YOU KNOW, UNTIL THEY KNOW HOW MUCH YOU CARE.**  
> GEORGE A. VUXTON, Dealer  
> BELTONE HEARING AID CENTER  
> 406 Walnut Street  
> ELMIRA, NEW YORK

In 1973 a group of students at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah sent a letter to the student newspaper. The letter included an instance of the saying with an anonymous attribution:[6](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2024/07/04/know-care/#b03cdf3c-566c-48f2-9a4a-2adde85794ad)

> The statement has been appropriately made, **“I don’t care how much you know until I know how much you care.”**

In 1978 Zig Ziglar wrote “See You At the Top”, and he used a version of the expression:[7](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2024/07/04/know-care/#4863bae6-5f49-47f7-a906-238bd5ddc0be)

> It truly “pays” to be genuinely interested in others because **employees “don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.”**

In 1984 Zig Ziglar wrote “Secrets of Closing the Sale”, and he used the expression again:[8](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2024/07/04/know-care/#b84688e6-d554-4406-9fd5-2c51b558ba15)

> When you are on a sales interview, whether you are selling a product or a business opportunity, you must believe deeply, firmly, and sincerely that what you offer is in the best interests of the person you are trying to persuade to take action. If you believe this way you can sincerely pull for your prospect to buy for his benefit. . . . It’s true, as a wise man said: **“People don’t really care how much you know—until they know how much you care.”**

In 1985 the book “The Great Communicators” included a chapter by Lee S. Shapiro which contained the following passage:[9](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2024/07/04/know-care/#84e9b705-75f8-4a7b-bf7b-6d5a356a39cd)

> “What you must know is that everyone wants to love and be loved, to feel that they’re important, that they matter . . . Give them the wonderful gift of listening, catch them doing something right, ask them a question, let them know that you care. **They don’t care how much you know, until they know how much you care.”**

In 1986 “One Minute Messages” by Dan Clark with Michael Gale included the following:[10](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2024/07/04/know-care/#7b26a001-fdde-4d90-b664-9e038f758e6d)

> When others are talking, don’t just be reloading your own mouth to talk, let them know you hear what they’re saying. Listen to learn. **People don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.**

In 1989 the following appeared as an epigraph at the beginning of the book “Be a People Person” by John C. Maxwell:[11](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2024/07/04/know-care/#4f74abc6-fb6f-4333-801c-24539780221d)

> **People don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.**

In 1995 by John C. Maxwell wrote the following in “Developing the Leaders Around You”:[12](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2024/07/04/know-care/#e3ed4424-7537-4e76-8a30-2968d956ecc6)

> In all my years of leading people, I must have said this more than a thousand times: **“People don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.” It’s true.**

In 1997 “Reader’s Digest Quotable Quotes: Wit and Wisdom for All Occasions” contained the following entry:[13](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2024/07/04/know-care/#989ba833-4bc2-486e-98f0-bb2575272cef)

> **People want to know how much you care before they care how much you know.**  
> —JAMES F. HIND in The Wall Street Journal

In 2009 a newspaper in Manitowoc, Wisconsin printed the remarks of a fitness facility owner who attributed the saying to the 28th U.S. President:[14](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2024/07/04/know-care/#f7778e07-7f59-4e52-a31a-8d207066d6a0)

> The fitness buff points to a president when coming up with his secret to success. “I truly believe in the famous quote by Theodore Roosevelt: **‘Nobody cares how much you know, until they know how much you care.’** Especially in the fitness industry, we are simply a means to an end and true success lies in motivating others to change their lives for the better.”

In conclusion, this is a modern adage with an anonymous provenance. Margaret Tyson who was the dean of a nursing school used the saying by 1959, and the Beltone Hearing Aid Company used the motto by 1962. Future researchers my uncover earlier evidence. **QI** has found no substantive evidence for the attribution to Theodore Roosevelt.
