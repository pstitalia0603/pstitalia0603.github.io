# [Best Breakfast Casserole (Hash Browns & Eggs)](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/87013/hash-brown-and-egg-casserole/)

1.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square pan; add hash brown potatoes and arrange in an even layer.
    
2.  Place sausage and onion in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir until the sausage is browned and crumbled, about 10 minutes; drain.
    
3.  Meanwhile, whisk eggs, milk, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl until well combined; pour over the potatoes and sprinkle with 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese. Add sausage mixture on top and sprinkle with remaining Cheddar. Cover with aluminum foil.
    
4.  Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Remove foil; return casserole to the oven and bake until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, about 10 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
