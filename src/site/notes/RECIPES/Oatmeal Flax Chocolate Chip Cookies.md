This recipe is like a typical chocolate chip cookie but with a few healthier changes. Instead of butter, you use coconut oil. Just melt the coconut oil until itâ€™s liquid and measure as you would another oil like canola. I love using coconut oil. I usually buy coconut oil from Trader Joeâ€™s or Costco. I also love [this one from Amazon](https://amzn.to/3QdurDH).Â 

In this cookie recipe, you add a full cup of oats and 1/2 a cup of flax seed! I adapted this recipe from Averie Cooksâ€™ recipe for [Soft and Chewy Oatmeal Coconut Chocolate Chip Cookies](http://www.averiecooks.com/2013/12/soft-and-chewy-oatmeal-coconut-chocolate-chip-cookies.html). I have been wanting to make a cookie and pack it full of flax seed since itâ€™s so good for you! [You can read more about the benefits of flaxseed and how to use it in this post.](https://lovetobeinthekitchen.com/2012/01/12/flax-seed/) When I was making this recipe I wasnâ€™t sure if 1/2 a cup of flaxseed would be too much but it turned out to be perfect! You hardly notice except that you can see it in the cookie. It gives it a darker color than a typical chocolate chip cookie. If youâ€™d like more coconut flavor, you could even add 1/2 a cup of shredded coconut to these cookies. (But may need to add a little more melted coconut oil if it seems too dry.)

Mmm! These cookies were so good! My kids loved them too and they are my toughest critics.

Just a note about the recipe, the dough needs to be chilled for at least 2 hours in the fridge. I just place all my dough balls on one cookie sheet, cover it with plastic wrap, and put it in the fridge. But if you are short on time you can just place it in the freezer for 15 minutes and that will work. This helps the cookies not to spread and enhances the flavor. Also, I love to add some chocolate chips on top to make it look prettier and give it more chocolatey goodness!

Enjoy!

## Ingredients

-   1 large egg
-   1/2 cup melted coconut oil
-   1/2 cup light brown sugar, packed
-   1/4 cup granulated sugar
-   1 tablespoon vanilla extract
-   1 teaspoon cinnamon
-   Â¼ teaspoon salt
-   1 teaspoon baking soda
-   1 cup old-fashioned whole rolled oats (not instant or quick)
-   1 cup all-purpose flour
-   Â½ cup finely ground flaxseed
-   3/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips

## Instructions

1.  In a large mixing bowl, or bowl of a stand mixer, add the egg, coconut oil, sugars, vanilla, cinnamon and salt. Mix until combined.
2.  Add the baking soda, oats, flour, and flaxseed and mix until combined. Mix in the chocolate chips.
3.  Form the dough into balls and place on a cookie sheet lined with a Silpat or parchment paper. Top with more chocolate chips if desired. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate or at least 2 hours or up to 5 days. This will help the cookies not to spread. (Shortcut: Freeze for about 15 minutes.) Also, the cookies wonâ€™t spread much after being chilled so if you want the cookies to be a little flatter press down slightly.
4.  Preheat oven to 350 F, line 2 baking sheets with a Silpat or parchment paper. Place the cookie dough balls 2 inches apart. Bake about 9 minutes or until edges and top are just beginning to set. Do not bake longer than 10 minutes to ensure the cookies are still soft. They will firm up as they cool. Let cookies cool for 5 minutes before transferring to cooling rack.
5.  Store cookies in an airtight container for up to 1 week or freeze for up to 4 months. The cookie dough can be stored in an airtight container for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 4 months.
