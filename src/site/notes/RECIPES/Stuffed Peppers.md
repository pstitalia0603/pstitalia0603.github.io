# [Stuffed Peppers - Once Upon a Chef](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/stuffed-peppers.html#tabrecipe)


*Classic stuffed peppers filled with ground beef, rice, tomato sauce, and cheese make an easy weeknight supper.*

Almost every cuisine has a version of stuffed peppers, or hollowed bell peppers filled with meat, tomato sauce, vegetables, rice and cheese. In the US, the dish undeniably retro â€“ in fact, the most popular internet recipe comes from the one and only Betty Crocker. Here, Iâ€™ve given the classic recipe a little update by quickly tenderizing the beef before cooking and seasoning it with Southwestern spices, which complement the sweetness of the bell peppers perfectly. That said, the recipe is endlessly versatile; you can change up the meat, spices, grain, or cheese to give the dish a whole new spin. This version goes nicely with cornbread.

The peppers need to be par-cooked before filling so that they cook through. Many recipes call for boiling the peppers first, but I prefer to roast them â€“ more flavor and less cleanup! The best way is to slice the peppers in half from the stem end down through the base, remove all the seeds and membranes, and then roast the halves until theyâ€™re tender-crisp.

## What Youâ€™ll Need To Make Stuffed Peppers

When selecting bell peppers, look for peppers that are bright, shiny and firm. They should not have wrinkled skin, soft spots, or moldy stems. I prefer red, orange, or yellow peppers; green peppers are unripe and have an unpleasant, somewhat bitter taste. (If left to fully ripen, green peppers will eventually turn another color, and the flavor will become increasingly sweet.) Bell peppers keep for up to a week in the refrigerator crisper drawer.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

Tenderize the beef: In a medium bowl, add the beef, 1 teaspoon of the salt, and the baking soda.

Use your hands to mix until evenly combined, and let the mixture sit for 20 minutes while you continue with the recipe. As it rests, the baking soda raises the pH of the meat, helping to lock in moisture and making the beef tender. 
Slice the peppers in half from the stem end down through the base.

Remove all the seeds and membranes.

Place the peppers, cut side up, in a 9Ã—13-inch baking dish; drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the oil and sprinkle with the remaining salt. Roast the peppers for about 20 minutes, until slightly browned and tender-crisp. A bit of liquid will accumulate in the bottom of the peppers; thatâ€™s okay.

Meanwhile, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil over medium heat in a large nonstick skillet. Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, until soft and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes.

Add the garlic and cook 1 minute more; do not brown.

To the skillet, add the ground beef mixture, chili powder, cumin, and oregano and increase the heat to medium high.

Cook, breaking the meat up with a wooden spoon, until the meat is browned and almost cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the tomato sauce and bring to a boil.

Reduce the heat to medium low and cook, uncovered, until the meat is cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the rice and 3/4 cup of the cheese.

Stir until melted and remove the skillet from the heat.

Remove the peppers from the oven and spoon the meat filling evenly into the peppers. Sprinkle with the remaining 3/4 cup cheese and place back in the oven.

Roast for 10 to 15 minutes, until the filling is hot and the cheese is melted and bubbling, and serve.

Classic stuffed peppers filled with ground beef, rice, tomato sauce, and cheese make an easy weeknight supper.

### Ingredients

-   1 pound 90% lean ground beef
-   1Â¼ teaspoons salt, divided
-   Heaping Â¼ teaspoon baking soda
-   3 large red, yellow, or orange bell peppers, cut in half from the stem to the bottom and cored
-   3 tablespoons extra-virgin oil
-   1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped
-   3 cloves garlic, minced
-   1Â½ teaspoons chili powder
-   Â½ teaspoon ground cumin
-   Â¼ teaspoon dried oregano
-   1 (8-oz) can tomato sauce
-   1 cup cooked rice, quinoa, or any grain
-   1Â½ cups shredded Monterey Jack or Cheddar Jack cheese

### Instructions

1.  Preheat the oven to 425Â°F and set an oven rack in the middle position.
2.  Tenderize the beef: In a medium bowl, using your hands, mash the beef with 1 teaspoon of the salt and the baking soda. Let sit for 20 minutes while you continue with the recipe.
3.  Line a 9x13-inch baking dish with aluminum foil for easy clean-up, if you like. Place the peppers, cut side up, in the baking dish; drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the oil and sprinkle with the remaining Â¼ teaspoon salt.
4.  Roast the peppers for about 20 minutes, until slightly browned and tender-crisp. A bit of liquid will accumulate in the bottom of the peppers; that's okay.
5.  Meanwhile, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil over medium heat in a large nonstick skillet. Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, until soft and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute more; do not brown. Add the ground beef mixture, chili powder, cumin, and oregano and increase the heat to medium high. Cook, breaking the meat up with a wooden spoon, until the meat is browned and almost cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the tomato sauce and bring to a boil; reduce the heat to medium low and cook, uncovered, until the meat is cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the rice and Â¾ cup of the cheese, and stir until melted. Remove the skillet from the heat.
6.  Remove the peppers from the oven and spoon the meat filling evenly into the peppers. Sprinkle with the remaining Â¾ cup cheese and place back in the oven. Roast for 10 to 15 minutes, until the filling is hot and the cheese is melted and bubbling, and serve.
7.  Make-Ahead Instructions: The peppers can be partially cooked and filled with the beef mixture up to 2 days ahead of time and refrigerated, or frozen in an airtight container for up to 3 months. When ready to serve, defrost overnight in the refrigerator if frozen, cover the dish with foil, and bake in a 425Â°F-oven for about 15 minutes. Remove the dish from the oven and remove and discard the foil. Top the peppers with the cheese and place back in the oven for about 5 minutes, or until the filling is heated through and the cheese is melted.
