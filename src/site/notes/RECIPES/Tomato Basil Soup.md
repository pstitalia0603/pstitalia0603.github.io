Total 25 mins, includes cooling time

Active 15 mins

Makes 6 servings

Directions

1.  To make the tomato basil soup: In a large soup pot, heat the olive oil and garlic together over medium-low heat until the garlic begins to brown, about 4 minutes. Add the tomatoes and 2 cups of chicken broth. Increase the heat to medium and bring to a gentle boil. Reduce the heat to low. Add the salt and pepper and slowly pour in the cream, stirring constantly. Add more broth if a looser soup is desired. Drop in the basil leaves and stir.
2.  Use an immersion blender to puree the soup until smooth. (Alternatively, let cool slightly and, working in batches as necessary, process in a stand blender until smooth, filling the blender no more than half full and removing the little steam vent in the top of the lid.)
3.  Ladle the soup into bowls. Drizzle some olive oil on top and scatter over some sliced basil.
