# [GitHub - vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync)

## Self-hosted LiveSync

[Japanese docs](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync/blob/main/README_ja.md) - [Chinese docs](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync/blob/main/README_cn.md).

Self-hosted LiveSync is a community-implemented synchronization plugin, available on every obsidian-compatible platform and using CouchDB or Object Storage (e.g., MinIO, S3, R2, etc.) as the server.

[![obsidian_live_sync_demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45774780/137355323-f57a8b09-abf2-4501-836c-8cb7d2ff24a3.gif)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45774780/137355323-f57a8b09-abf2-4501-836c-8cb7d2ff24a3.gif)

Note: This plugin cannot synchronise with the official "Obsidian Sync".

## Features

-   Synchronize vaults very efficiently with less traffic.
-   Good at conflicted modification.
    -   Automatic merging for simple conflicts.
-   Using OSS solution for the server.
    -   Compatible solutions can be used.
-   Supporting End-to-end encryption.
-   Synchronisation of settings, snippets, themes, and plug-ins, via [Customization sync(Beta)](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync#customization-sync) or [Hidden File Sync](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync#hiddenfilesync)
-   WebClip from [obsidian-livesync-webclip](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/obsidian-livesync-webclip/jfpaflmpckblieefkegjncjoceapakdf)

This plug-in might be useful for researchers, engineers, and developers with a need to keep their notes fully self-hosted for security reasons. Or just anyone who would like the peace of mind of knowing that their notes are fully private.

Important

-   Before installing or upgrading this plug-in, please back your vault up.
-   Do not enable this plugin with another synchronization solution at the same time (including iCloud and Obsidian Sync).
-   This is a synchronization plugin. Not a backup solution. Do not rely on this for backup.

Tip

Now, fly.io has become not free. Fortunately, even though there are some issues, we are still able to use IBM Cloudant. Here is [Setup IBM Cloudant](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync/blob/main/docs/setup_cloudant.md). It will be updated soon!
