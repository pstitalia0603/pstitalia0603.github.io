- [x] Difference in Hours ðŸ›« 2024-05-28 âœ… 2024-05-28 
 

## Yesterday is relative
<span><span>NOTES/DAILY NOTES/2024/08-Aug/2024-08-02.md</span></span>


## Yesterday is relative, but grabs frontmatter from yesterday
<span><span>IF_START: 2024-08-02T18:27:00.000-04:00</span></span>

## Yesterday is relative, but does calculation between notes
<span><span>IF_END not found for today.</span></span>



## Grabs frontmatter from date_created today (not relative)
<span>2024-05-28</span>


## Calculates non-relative yesterday
<span><span>2024-05-27</span></span>

## Non-relative yesterday and today
<span><span>Today: 2024-05-28, Yesterday: 2024-05-27</span></span>


## Best way to grab frontmatter from current note:
dv.current().date_created


## This is the final correct code!
<span><span>Difference in hours between IF_START from yesterday and IF_END from today: 13</span></span>


## Without Metaedit Plugin
<span><span><strong>Fasting overnight Hours:</strong> 13</span></span>
